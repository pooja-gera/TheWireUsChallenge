Answer: (B)

Explanation: SQ1 : SELECT * FROM One
EXCEPT
(SELECT * FROM Two);
It will result into single tuple (2, 5) because all duplicate tuples will be removed.
SQ2 : SELECT * FROM One)
EXCEPT ALL
(SELECT * FROM Two);
It will result into 2 tuples <(2,5), (1.6)> because it will not remove duplicate.
