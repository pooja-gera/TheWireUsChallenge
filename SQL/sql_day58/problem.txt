Ques.Consider the following relational schema:
Suppliers(sid:integer, sname:string, city:string, street:string)
Parts(pid:integer, pname:string, color:string)
Catalog(sid:integer, pid:integer, cost:real)
Consider the following relational query on the above database:
	  SELECT S.sname
    	  FROM Suppliers S
   	  WHERE S.sid NOT IN (SELECT C.sid
                  FROM Catalog C
                  WHERE C.pid NOT IN (SELECT P.pid  
                  FROM Parts P
                  WHERE P.color<> 'blue'))
Assume that relations corresponding to the above schema are not empty.
