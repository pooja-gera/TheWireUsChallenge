Answer: (C)

Explanation: When a subquery uses values from outer query, the subquery is called correlated subquery. The correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query.
The outer query selects 4 entries (with pids as 0, 1, 5, 3) from Reservation table. Out of these selected entries, the subquery returns Non-Null values only for 1 and 3.
