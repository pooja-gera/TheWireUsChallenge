heyya guys!!!
I hope you guys are doing amazing and having fun in all the challanges.

So hre comes another fun module for you to learn 
This is know as statsmodels.

What is Statsmodels API?
statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator.

Why statsmodels?
Python StatsModels allows users to explore data, perform statistical tests and estimate statistical models. It is supposed to complement to SciPy's stats module. It is part of the Python scientific stack that deals with data science, statistics and data analysis.

If you haven't heard about this you can check it out at-
https://thequackdaddy.github.io/statsmodels.github.io/0.9.0/release/version0.5.html


So the challanges are
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Code to print the probability plots with options to fit distribution and various reference lines using statsmodels 
3. code to print a mosaic plot using the necessary libraries
4. give the above data in hierarchichal index series

ALL THE BEST!!!
