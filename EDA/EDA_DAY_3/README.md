Hello guys!!!
I hope you all are doing great.So, now there's time to move a little forward.
Here is another challenge for you guys. The next module we're gonna learn is known as scipy. 

What is SciPy?
SciPy is a set of open source (BSD licensed) scientific and numerical tools for Python. It currently supports special functions, integration, ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers, gradient optimization, parallel programming tools, an expression-to-C++ compiler for fast execution, and others. A good rule of thumb is that if it’s covered in a general textbook on numerical computing (for example, the well-known Numerical Recipes series), it’s probably implemented in SciPy.

Why use SciPy?
1. SciPy contains varieties of sub packages which help to solve the most common issue related to Scientific Computation.
2. SciPy is the most used Scientific library only second to GNU Scientific Library for C/C++ or Matlab's.
3. Easy to use and understand as well as fast computational power.
4. It can operate on an array of NumPy library.

I am sure you guys have learnt matrices, derterminants and eigen vectors. These were the fun topics of class 12th. 
So the questions are -
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Write a command to find cube root of 27 and 64
3. Define exp10 function and pass value in its
4. Code to determine the determinant of a square matrix
5. Code to find the eigenvalue of a corresponding eigenvector of a 2 dimensional matrix.

ALL THE BEST!!!
