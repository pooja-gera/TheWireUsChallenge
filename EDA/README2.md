Hello coders!!! 
I hope everyone is doing fine and learning new things everyday. 
I know the journey is long and tough but we can do it together and can achieve many things. I hope you guys have done the challenge for day 1, if there are any doubts you can let us know and 
DON'T SHY.
Okay, so here is the challenge for day 2 
Day 2 is for numpy library . I am sure you guys have heard about it a lot it is used in python for different operations in arrays and lists and many more. 
If not, you can check it out at 
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/

so the challenge for day 2 is very easy ->
1. First you need to import the required libraries
2. You need to make a floating point array of 2x3 and the access different elements of the array using negative indices too
3. Write a function to determine the shape and the type of the array
4. A command to generate an array of random numbers
5. Use of 'in' statement
6. Command to reshape the array in a form of square matrix
7. Command to convert the array into a list

After doing these questions you can go ahead and play with different functions of numpy array and trust me IT IS FUN.
