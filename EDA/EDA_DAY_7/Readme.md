Heyya guys!
I hope you all are doing fine and learning new things everyday.
Just remember 
No pain, no gain.

So here is another challenge for you on another library know as Seaborn.

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.

Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.

So the tasks are 
1. import necessary libraries
2. create a distplot with histogram
3. create same without histogram

All the best!
