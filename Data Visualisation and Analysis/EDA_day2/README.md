Hello fellow data scientists! So proud of you for sticking with us till the second day *sobs*
So for today's challenge, we have a bunch of unclean data (movies.csv) that you gotta sort and filter through to answer the following questions:
Q1. Print a list of the columns.
Q2. From the list of columns, find a name of the column with the budget of the movies. Use the dot notation to extract this to a variable.
Q3. Print the first 20 rows of the new variable you created.
Q4. Create a new DataFrame with 2 columns from the movies.csv dataset.
Q5. Give a numerical summary of the data you have with you. What is the standard deviation of the revenue?
