Hello fellow data scientist! Congratulations to you for sticking till day 5! Today is the last challenge on introductory data cleaning and before we begin data visualisation.  Today, you'll be applying everything you learned so far into answering the following questions for our new dataset:
1. Who gets hired? What kind of talent do employers want when they are hiring a data scientist?
2. Which location has the most opportunities?
3. What skills, tools, degrees or majors do employers want the most for data scientists?
4. What's the difference between data scientist, data engineer and data analyst?
