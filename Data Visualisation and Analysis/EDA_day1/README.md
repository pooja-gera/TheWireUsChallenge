Hi fellow data scientist! So for your first challenge, you have to work on the movies.csv dataset provided to you. You have to perform a bunch of data cleaning on the data and provide the answers to the following questions:
1. Is there missing data in the dataset?
2. What percent of the movies.csv dataset is missing?
3. Give an analysis of what data you think might be missing because it didn't exist or because it was not recorded.
4. Remove all rows from the dataset that contain missing values. How many are left?
Remove all columns with empty values. Now how much of your data is left?
5. Replace all the NaN's with the value that comes directly after it and then replacing any remaining NaN's with 0.
