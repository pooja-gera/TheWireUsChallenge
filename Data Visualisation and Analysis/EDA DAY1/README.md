Hey!! 
I hope everyone is doing fine in their challenges and learning new things everyday.
So here is another challenge for all of you in the field of data analysis.

Data is truly considered a resource in today’s world. As per the World Economic Forum, by 2025 we will be generating about 463 exabytes of data globally per day. Data can be generated in the form of text, audio, video, etc. So before feeding our data in ML models, we need to clean the data so that machine can understand the data as machines can understand only 0 and 1’s. Data Preprocessing is the technique that transforms raw data (text, audio, etc) to an understandable format for machines.

Why do we need Data Preprocessing? Raw data is always messy and that data also contains errors and that data cannot be sent through a model. There are various types of analysis that we can do on data:

Descriptive Analysis – In descriptive analysis we summarize the data that has happened in the past.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – In EDA we summarize the data through visual methods.
Predictive Analysis – Predictive Analysis predicts the likelihood of something based on current and historical facts.
Inferential Analysis – In inferential analysis we are trying to understand what causes a particular outcome.
What is EDA? EDA is the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

Why do we need EDA?

Detection of mistakes and missing data.
Checking of assumptions.
Preliminary selection of appropriate models.
Determining relationships among the explanatory variables.
Why skipping EDA is a bad idea?

Generates inaccurate models.
Generating accurate models on wrong data.
Choosing wrong variables for model.
Inefficient use of resources, including rebuilding of model.
Major Steps to be followed to do EDA

1. Importing the libraries
2. Checking type of data
3. Dropping irrelevant columns
4. Finding missing values
5. Removing the duplicates
6. calculate the mean of the values group by sex of passengers
7. Plotting histogram of the dataset 

All of the above tasks are performed using the libraries pandas and matplotlib. 
I am sure the you guys must have heard about these libraries, if not you can check it out

Now we will perform EDA on Titanic dataset.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

The challenge is to perform these steps on the given dataset.
And don't forget to first upload the csv file of dataset.
