### Finding the Greatest Common Divisor

For this challenge, you have to find the GCD of two numbers (both positive) (example: 12345678 and 987654). The output for the example should be 6.

**Hint:** Use Euclidean algorithm

**Note:** The extended Euclidean algorithm is particularly useful when a and b are coprime (or gcd is 1). Since x is the modular multiplicative inverse of “a modulo b”, and y is the modular multiplicative inverse of “b modulo a”. In particular, the computation of the modular multiplicative inverse is an essential step in RSA public-key encryption method.
