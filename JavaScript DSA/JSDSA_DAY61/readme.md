<b>Well it would be easy for those who has seen a keypad "Button" wala phone in their life.....  </b> 

### Challenge -
1. You are given a string str. The string str will contains numbers only, where each number stands for a key pressed on a mobile phone.
2. The following list is the key to characters map :
    0 -> .;
    1 -> abc
    2 -> def
    3 -> ghi
    4 -> jkl
    5 -> mno
    6 -> pqrs
    7 -> tu
    8 -> vwx
    9 -> yz
3. Now just like the good old days, you have to get all the combinations of words you can make with those two numbers into an array and return it.

### Note - Each key can pe pressed as many times as it has number of characters mapped to it. i.e - 7 can be used to form t and u.
