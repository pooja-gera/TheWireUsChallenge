Problem Statement: Print inverted half pyramid of * using javascript

Explaination: So this is a basic problem statement and you might be familiar with loops.In this program, we are 
	      implementing logic to print Reverse Half Pyramid pattern using asterisks and loops (nested loops).


Logic : For user input = 5
i	height	Number of * (= height â€“ i + 1)
1	5	5		* * * * *
2	5	4		* * * *
3	5	3		* * *
4	5	2		* *
5	5	1		*

Here the outer loop runs the maximum time and with each iteration the number og asterisks to be printed also keeps on decreasing.

Hope this helps!
