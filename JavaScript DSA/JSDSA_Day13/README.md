### Two Sum

For this challenge, you have to return **ALL** the pairs that add up to a specific target.

For example, consider the array [2, 1, 3, 4, 2], say you want to find all the pairs that add up to 4. So, you should return an array [[2, 2], [1, 3]].
There will be multiple approaches for this problem, try to find the fastest one!
