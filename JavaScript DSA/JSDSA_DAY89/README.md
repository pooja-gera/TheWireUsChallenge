## Segregate array of 0s, 1s and 2s 

### Challenge
This problem seems pretty straight forward right? Well you might be thinking would the big deal in this we will count the occurrences of 0s, 1s and 2s and then over-write the original array ?

But that’s not the case fellas.. I challenge you to solve this problem just using one iteration.

Hint: Ever heard of the Dutch National Flag Algorithm. Well then get started with it if you haven’t.. :)
 
 
Input: 

Arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2}

Output:

Arr[] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}
