### Shuffle an array

For this challenge, imagine you were given a pack of cards and were asked to shuffle it. That is exactly what you have to do today, instead, here we take an array and then randomise the given array.

**Note:** Here shuffle means that every permutation of array element should equally likely.

**Hint:** Use Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle Algorithm
This can also be done using the random method in JavaScript, but it does not give the desired result (equally likely permutations)
