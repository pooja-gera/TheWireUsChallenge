## Leaders In An Array

An element is a leader in an array if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. Also the rightmost element is always a leader in an array.

### Challenge: 

We need to write an efficient program to solve the issue in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.

Input: arr[] = {5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3}
	
Output: 6, 4, 3


Input: arr[] = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}
	
Output: 17, 5, 2
