## Print Maze Path --- 

### Challenge -
1. You are given a number n and a number m representing number of rows and columns in a maze.
2. You are standing in the top-left corner and have to reach the bottom-right corner. Only two moves are allowed 'h' (1-step horizontal) and 'v' (1-step vertical).
3. Complete the body of pri tMazePath function - without changing signature - to print the list of all paths that can be used to move from top-left to bottom-right.
## Imp -- Please do this question using recursion.

### Note - Each key can pe pressed as many times as it has number of characters mapped to it. i.e - 7 can be used to form t and u.

## Note and Advice -- The code of recurssion is always small but the logic behind it is the real deal. So always dray stack and tree of recursion.
