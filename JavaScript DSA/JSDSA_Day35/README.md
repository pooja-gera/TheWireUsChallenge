### Find the middle element of a singly linked list

For this challenge, write a code to find the middle element of a singly linked list. To make things more interesting, try doing this in a single pass, i.e., you can traverse the list only once.

Example: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 9
Your code should return 2 (since it is the middle element)
