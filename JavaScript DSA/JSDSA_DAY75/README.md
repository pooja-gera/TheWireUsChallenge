## Water Overflow

### Challenge
There are some glasses with equal capacity as 1 litre. The glasses are kept as follows:
					
					     1
					
					2		3
			
				4		5		6

			7		8		9		10


You can put the water to only top glass. If you put more than 1 litre water to 1st glass, water overflows and fills equally in both 2nd and 3rd glasses. Glass 5 will get water from both 2nd glass and 3rd glass and so on.

If you have X litre of water and you put that water in the top glass, how much water will be contained in the jth glass in the ith row?

Sample Case:

If you put 2 litre on top.
1st glass will have 1 litre
2nd and 3rd glass each will have ½ litre


Hint: The approach is similar to that of Pascal’s Triangle.

So Get started and keep the spirit up!!
