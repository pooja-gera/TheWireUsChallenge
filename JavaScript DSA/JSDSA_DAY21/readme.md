## BitWise Fun
 This Challenge is gonna be more aboout thinking and less about coding so please think a lot before seeing the solutions.
 (Use hints and resources to start your thinking process.)

#### Challenge - 
 There are gonna be a number of mini challenges.
1. Take a number "n" as a input from user.
2. <b> Now think a way to return 2^n without using any multiplcation or any kind of loop.</b>
3. <b> Now divide the number by 4 without using divide operator.
4. <b> Tell whether N is even or odd without using / or % operator.
#### A bonus challenge -- 
4. <b> Now let's try something more a little bit more challenging --- 
5. Let us asume you have N pairs of shoes numbered from 0 to N-1.
6. Now one of the shoes from one of the pairs is missing.
7. You have to find the number which is single(Not in pair).

##### Example For basic challenge-
<pre>Input - 6                                     Input - 7                                     
   output - 64 (2^6)                               Output - 128 (2^7)                                                
            1 (6/4)                                         1    (7/4)                                                
            Even                                            Odd               
</pre>
