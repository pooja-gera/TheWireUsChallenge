### Create a Binary Search Tree

A tree (non linear data structure) is a collection of nodes connected by some edges. A Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which nodes that have **lesser value** are stored on the **left** while the nodes with a **higher value** are stored at the **right**. For this challenge, create a basic Binary Search Tree and print the values of nodes in ascending order.

**Hint:** You can use [this](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html) visualization to get a clear idea of what a BST is.
