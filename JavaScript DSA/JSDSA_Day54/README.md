### Knapsack Problem

For this challenge, imagine you were given the weight and values of 'N' items. You are now asked to put these items in a knapsack which has a capacity 'C'. The goal is to get the maximum value from the items in the knapsack.

**Note:** Each item can only be selected once, as we do not have multiple quantities of any item.
