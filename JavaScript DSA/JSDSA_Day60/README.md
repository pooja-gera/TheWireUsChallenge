### Longest Common Subsequence

The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem. It is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). 

**Note:** Unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

**Example:** Longest common subsequence for "ABCDEF" and "ACBEDF" is "ABDF" of length 4
