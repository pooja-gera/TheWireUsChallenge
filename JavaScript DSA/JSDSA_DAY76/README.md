## FIND THE LAND PLEASE!!

###CHALLENGE

We have 5 X 5 matrix in which 1 represents land and 0 represent water. You Need to create a function which will iterate through the matrix and return the number of lands it finds and the coordinates where the land is present. Diagonal 1's need to be ignored.

Sample Input:

var arr = [
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
];
