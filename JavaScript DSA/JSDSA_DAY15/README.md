## Minimum swaps required to bring all elements less than or equal to k together

### Challenge: 

Given an array of n positive integers and a number k. Find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together.

Input: arr[] = {2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 4}, k=5

Output: 2

Explanation: To bring elements 2, 4, 5 together, swap element ‘5’ with ‘9’ and similarly swap ‘7’ with ‘4’ such that final array will be 
{2, 4, 5, 9, 8, 7, 7}
