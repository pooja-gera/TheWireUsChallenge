## Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees
Input a square matrix from the user and turn it 90 degree in clockwise direction

### Challenge: 
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Input:
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]

	
Output: 
 [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]

Input:
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
Output:

  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
