## 2-Dimensional Array
This challenge will introduce you to make arrays of array also known as 2D arrays or Matrix.

#### Note - Please refer to resources to read about storing elements in matrix in JS.)

### Challenge - 
1. Take an input r, the size of row.
2. Take an input c, the size of column.
3. Take r*c more inputs and store that in an matrix.
4. Write a function Wave print it row-wise and then column wise.

5. By wave print row-wise we mean to start from top left of matrix then move left to right to end of column and then from right to left in next row and so on, till we reach to last right most cell of matrix.
6. By wave print column-wise we mean to start from top left of matrix then move from top to bottom to end of row and then from bottom to top in next column  and so on, till we reach to last right most cell of matrix. 

#### Example(To be used only for expected output): 
<pre>
Input:
3
3
1 2 3 (we will take 9 inputs from user)
4 5 6
7 8 9
Output:
1 2 3 6 5 4 7 8 9
1 4 7 8 5 2 3 6 9
</pre>
