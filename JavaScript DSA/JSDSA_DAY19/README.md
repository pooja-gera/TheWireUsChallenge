## Largest Sum Contiguous SubArray

This is a standard problem but still lets have a look 

### Challenge: 

We need to write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum

Input: arr[] = {-5, -6, 1, 2, -2, -1, 4, -1, -3}
	
	Here the maximum sum of contiguous subArray is 1+2+(-2)+(-1)+4

Output: 4


Input: arr[] = {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3}
	
	Here the maximum contiguous array sum is 4+(-1)+(-2)+1+5

Output: 7
