### Find the intersection of two arrays

For this challenge, you have to find the intersection of two arrays. An intersection would be the common 
elements that exists within both arrays. In this case, these elements should be unique!

 Example: If A = [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 8, 9] and B = [6, 3, 2, 7, 5]
 Then, the answer should be [3, 2, 5]
