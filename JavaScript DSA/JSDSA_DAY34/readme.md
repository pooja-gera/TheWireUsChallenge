 # Day - 34

## Messing with ASCII
ASCII Values plays a very important role in Data Structures of any language. Because at the end of the day computer reads values in the form of their ASCII values. So it's always handy to know ASCII values of commonly used charaters.   
### Note - Please refer to resources for ASCII values.

### Challenge - 
1. Take a string as input.
2. Write a function that toggles the case of all characters in the string and then
   print that String.

#### Note - 
Changing case means changing capital letters into small and vice versa

#### Example(To be used only for expected output): 
<pre>
Input:                       Input:                         
AbCs                           Hello I Am Prateek           
Output:                      Output:                        
aBcS                           hELLO i aM pRATEEK                        
</pre>         

### Note - 
The entered string is case sensitive. (Means 'h' and 'H' are different. )
