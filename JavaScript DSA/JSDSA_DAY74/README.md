##MAXIMUM PROFIT WITH K TRANSACTIONS

###CHALLENGE

You are given an array of positive integers representing the prices of single stock on various days(each index in the array represents a different day). You’re also given an integer k which is the number of transactions you’re allowed to make. One transaction consists of buying the stock on a given day and selling it on another day.

Write a function that returns the maximum profit that you can make by buying and selling the stock.

Note: You can only buy one share of the stock at a time, in other words you can’t buy more than one share of the stock on any given day, and you can’t buy a share if you’re holding one. Also you don’t need to use all the k transactions.

Sample Input:
Array = [5, 11, 3, 50, 60, 90]
K = 2
Output:
93 

Explanation: Buy 5, sell 11, Buy 3, Sell 90
