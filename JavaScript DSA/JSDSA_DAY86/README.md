## Chocolate Distribution Problem


### Challenge
Given an array of chocolates integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:
1. Each student gets one packet.
2. The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.
Basically find a subArray where the maximum chocolates in a packet and the minimum chocolates in the subArray is minimum

So Buckle up and get started!!

Below is the sample input and output to get you more into this if you don’t understand.

Sample Input:

ArrayOfChocolates[] = {7, 2, 3, 4 ,9, 17, 56}


Sample Output:

Minimum difference is 2

Explanation:

We have seven packets of chocolates and we need to pick three packets for 3 students such that the difference in the number of Chocolates is minimum for the 3 students.
So in this case we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get minimum difference between maximum and minimum packet sizes as 2;
