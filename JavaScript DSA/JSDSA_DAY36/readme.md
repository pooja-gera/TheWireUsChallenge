## List Data Structure
List Data Structure is used to store a collection of data in which the order of data doesn't matter.
List is an Abstract Data Type. 
### Note - (Plese refer to resources to read more about Abstract Data Types).

1. Now the JavaScript doesn't have an inbuilt list data structure, but we needs list many times in our language. So, 
### Challenge -  
2. The challenge is to implement List Data Structure in JavaScript using Arrays.
3. The key features or the functions which your List should have are - 

    size() - return the number of elements present in your list.
    append(element) - adds the element on top of the list.
    find(element) - find the position of element in the list.
    remove(element) - removes the given element from the list.
    insert(element, after) - Insert element after the given element in the list
    contains(element) - Returns true or false based on whether list contains the given element.
    getElement() - Returns the element present at current position of list.
    (The underlined functions are used in traversing of list.)
    <U>front()</U> - moves to the first item of list.  
    <U>rear()</U> - moves to the last item of list.
    <U>prev()</U> - moves to previous item of list.
    <U>next()</U> - moves to next item of list.
    clear() - Clear all the item of the list making it empty.
    display() - Display the elements of the List in form of String.

#### Hints and Instructions: 
1. Use an Array as the base storage for storing elements of List.
2. Have a variable ListSize to handle the size function.
3. Have a position variable to have record of positions where you have to add element.
4. position variable can also be used in other functions like front , prev etc.
