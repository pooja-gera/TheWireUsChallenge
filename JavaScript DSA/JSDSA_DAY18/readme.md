## Target Sum Triplet
 It's a fun challenge and really helps to get into the working of loops and array's indexes.


#### Challenge - 
1. You will ask the user to input number of elements in the array N.
2. User will enter N elements to be stored in the array.
3. Now you will ask the user to enter a <b>"Target"</b> number.

#### Real challenge -- 
4. <b> Now you have to write a program to print all the triplets whose sum is equal to the Target number.</b>
5. The pattern in which you are supposed to print the triplets is fixed so observe the below example carefully. 

##### Example -
<pre>Input - 6                                     Input - 7

                                                   target - 85
                                                                                
Output -                                           Output -
