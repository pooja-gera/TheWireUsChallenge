## Count Number of Nodes in Complete Binary Tree

### Challenge
Given a binary tree you need to count the total number nodes in a binary tree

Now you might be thinking a basic approach of that we can count the nodes in left sub-tree and similarly count the nodes in the right sub-tree and return the result.
But this approach executes in O(n) time and it is applicable for all cases. But here we have a complete binary tree so come with some good approach.
