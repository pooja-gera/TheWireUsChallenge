Printing patterns play a very important role in getting comfortable with loops and conditional statements.

Challenge ---
You have to write a program which provides the user with a choice to print his desired pattern from the list of patterns --
1. Rigth Angled triangle    
    *
    * *
    * * *
    * * * *
    * * * * *
2. Mirror Right Angle triangle
        *
      * *
    * * *
  * * * *
* * * * *

3. Pyramid
        * 
      * * *
    * * * * *
  * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * *

4. Diamond
    * 
  * * *
* * * * *
  * * *
    * 

5. Number Diamond
    1 
  2 3 2
3 4 5 4 3
  4 5 4
    5 

input - 1. User will provide the number of rows he wants in the pattern as a input.
        2. Then your program should give him the list of patterns he can print, and will ask to give his choice of patttern as input.
        Your program will keep repeating the Step 1 and Step 2 until and unless user doesn't give the instruction to terminate the program.

output --- Pattern of user's desired choice.

For Example -- 
input - 
Enter number of rows : 
5 (Input 1 provided by user)
Press 1 for Right Angled Triangle.
Press 2 for Reverse andled Angled Triangle.
Press 3 for Pyramid.
Press 4 for Diamond.
Press 5 for Number Diamond
Press 0 TO exit
1(input 2 provided by user)
output - 
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *

then your program should again ask for number of rows and So on...............
