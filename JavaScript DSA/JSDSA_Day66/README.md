### Create a Max Heap

A heap is a tree-like data structure where each node must be ordered with respect to the value of its children. This ordering must persist throughout the entire heap. Put simply, a parent node’s value must always be greater (in the case of a min heap) than its children’s values.

For today's challenge, consider an array and create a min heap for the same.
