## Making a Pattern
 &nbsp;
 Lets increase the level of our patterns a bit ---- 
This challenge will help you to think how you can use a simple for loop and some conditional statements to make your desired pattern.

### Note - 
This challenge was asked in Codevita in year 2019. (See the link in resources)

#### Challenge - 
You have to take the number of rows as an input from the user and will have to print the pattern as shown in example

##### Please observe the output carefully to see the pattern it follows.
(Devil is always in the details.)

###### Example -
<pre>Input - 3        Input - 4                  Input - 5    
Output -              Output -                   Output -
