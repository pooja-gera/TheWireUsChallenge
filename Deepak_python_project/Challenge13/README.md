################# Palindrom generator ################## 
Palindrom :- those number whose value are still remain same if you reverse them 
first of all you need to take input from the user that how many number they want to test 
after that you need to take the number from the user and need to tell them the next palindrom number 
Just like :- 
if user input 63
Output:- 
66  (beacuse it is next palindrom number close to the 63 )
