##############OH soldier prettify my folder################ 

you need to create a function which take the full path of a file as an input.
It take also an dictonary file as an input (which include all the file whose your program need to ignore)
you need to rename all the .jpg file present in the folder from 1 to n
and also captilize the first letter of all the files present in it except files present in dictonary
for example :- deepak.jpg = 01Deepak.jpg
