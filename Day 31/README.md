EXPLANATION
During Diwali, it's a tradition that each father gives his kids money which they can spend on entertainment.
Kumar has N coins; let's denote the value of coin i by vi. Since today is Diwali, Kumar is going to give one coin to each of his two children. He wants the absolute value of the difference between the values of coins given to the two children to be as small as possible, so that he would be as fair as possible.
Help Kumar by telling him the minimum possible difference between the values of the coins given to the two children. Of course, Kumar cannot give the same coin to both children.
