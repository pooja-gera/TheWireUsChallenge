## Find the number
## DAY THIRTY TWO
## Challenge Master - Deekshita Verma 

EXPLANATION
While doing his school assignment, Keith managed to calculate the arithmetic average of m+p numbers, let’s denote the average by w.
Jones being jealous of the fact that Keith had finished his assignment secretly took the p numbers but with the same value out of the sequence.
Keith still knows the remaining m elements — a sequence A1,A2,…,Am. Help him with restoring the original sequence by finding the value of the deleted elements or deciding that there is some mistake and the described scenario is impossible.
Note that if it is possible for the deleted elements to have the same value, then it can be proven that it is unique. Also note that this value must be a positive integer.
INPUT REQUIREMENTS
•	The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
•	The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers m , p and w.
•	The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,Am.

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the value of the deleted elements, or −1−1 if there is a mistake.
