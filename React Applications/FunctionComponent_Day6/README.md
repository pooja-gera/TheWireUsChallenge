## Function Components ##

The other type of component in React is the simple component, which is a function. This component doesn't use the class keyword. Function Component is created similar to functions in JavaScript. When creating a Function Component in React remember that the name of const(if using arrow functions) or function name will be the name of your component. <br/><br/>

A class component must include render(), and the return can only return one parent element.
