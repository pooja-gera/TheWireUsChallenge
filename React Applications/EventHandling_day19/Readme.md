**EVENTS IN REACT**

In this challenge we will look how React can perform actions based on user events.React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.

React events are written in camelCase syntax:
*onClick* instead of *onclick*.

React event handlers are written inside curly braces:
onClick={shoot}  instead of onClick="shoot()".

Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly.
