## Class Components ##

As explained in Components_Day5 in React, we have created a class component in this challenge. <br/>
But instead of making changes in App.js we created a new component __Table__. When we create new components we capitalise them(similar to App.js) so that they can be differentiated from HTML elements(like div tags) at the time of rendering. <br/><br/>

Here we have created Table.js and in the end have exported it. This Table has been imported in App.js. We can create a number of other components and can import Table.js in each one of them(like explained for Header/Navbar in Creating Components in React). <br/><br/>

In the end App has also been exported from App.js and has been rendered in index.js.
