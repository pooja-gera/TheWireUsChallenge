**TicTacToe-Part6**

The last thing our Tic Tac Toe game needs is the Storage object. 
You need to use this object to create and update data in browser
localStorage object.

**Description:**

1. When initialized, it will check if localStorage contains any data 
from previous games. If not, it will create new item create new item 
in localStorage for our Tic Tac Toe game.

2. Next, add two methods, getData and update. The first one will get existing data localStorage.

3. The second one will push new data into localStorage. With this, we will
now be able to show records of previous games on the scoreboard view, or page.

See you in the next Challenge
