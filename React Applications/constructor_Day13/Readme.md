### Constructor

In the last challenge we have seen about React  lifecycle and its component.so here lets 
see in detail about constructor.

The **constructor()** method is called before anything else, when the component
is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other 
initial values.

The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should
always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate
the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from
its parent (React.Component).The constructor method is called, by React, ever
y time you make a component.

So now lets put this into a code and give a value to a variable through a constructor 
and print it.

Lets Begin!!!
