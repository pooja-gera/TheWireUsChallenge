**Lifecycle of Components|Updating**

**ComponentDidUpdate**

The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.


**Challenge Description**

**Hints:**

1. When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color "red".

2. When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and the color becomes "yellow".

3. This action triggers the update phase, and since this component has a
componentDidUpdate method, this method is executed and writes a message in the empty DIV element:

**Result:**  It will display the updated value.(Eg.*The updated favorite is yellow*)
