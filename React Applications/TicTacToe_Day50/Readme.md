**TicTacToe-Part3**

All Charged up to continue !! Hope you are done with the previous one.

In this challenge you need to complete the **The Scoreboard component**.

The Scoreboard component will be very simple. Similarly to Board, 
this will also be stateful component. 

**Challenge Description:**

1. Its state will contain one key/value pair, scoreboard. The value for this key
will be an empty array. After Scoreboard component mounts we will use Storage object
to load any data from local storage and update component state.

2. The render method will contain the list with previous games and link to start new game. 

3. For the link, use Link from react-router-dom library that will redirect the user 
on /board view, or page.

See you in the next Challenge
