**LISTS IN REACT**

In this challenge we will look about list and how it is used in React!
Lists are very useful when it comes to developing UI of any website. Lists are mainly used for
displaying menus in a website, for example, the navbar menu. In regular javascript we can 
use arrays for creating lists. We can create lists in React in a similar manner as we do
in regular JavaScript. we can traverse the list using the javascript map() function.

Consider the example of a Navigation Menu. It is obvious that in any webiste the items
in a navigation menu are not hardcoded. This items are fetched from database and then displayed
as lists in the browser. So from the componentâ€™s point of view we can say that we will
pass a list to a component using props and then use this component to render the list to the DOM. 

So I think by how you got i clear concept of how to get started .Great! Let's get going .
