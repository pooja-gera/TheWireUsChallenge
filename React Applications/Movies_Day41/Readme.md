### Day 41
---
Movies display challenge using Map. In this challenge you are going to make a javascript array with json objects in it. 

#### Requirements
1. Create a js file with a array. Later export that array of objects.

2. Each object should consists of a title, id, release_Date, avg_rating and any other custom stuff related to each movie.

3. Create minimum 3 objects of such type for 3 different movies. 

In the next challenge we are going to display this list of movies using map rather than hardcoding each movie data.
