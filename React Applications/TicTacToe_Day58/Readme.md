In the few Challenges from now, we will create a TicTacToe game.
Install the React Bootstrap Package to the project (**npm i bootstrap-4-react**)

Revise all basic concepts of Reactjs before starting this challenge.

**Challenge Hints-**

1. Run the basic installation commands and set up the folders
(command-*npx create-react-app react-tic-tac-toe*).

2. Our task will be to build all React components we will need 
for our Tic Tac Toe game. We will create four components,
*board-box.jsx, board.jsx, scoreboard.jsx and the index.jsx*.

 *Letâ€™s start with the simplest component in this challenge 
i.e.,board-box.jsx, component for individual boxes or squares
on the board.board-box.jsx, component for individual boxes or squares on the board.*

3. It will be a simple button with click handler and label, 
both passed by props.Lets code then!!!
