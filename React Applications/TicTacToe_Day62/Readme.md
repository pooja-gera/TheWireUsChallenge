**TicTacToe-Part5**

Our Tic Tac Toe game is almost finished. Pumped up !!!

I know you are ...so lets work!!!

Before we can let anyone try our React Tic Tac Toe we need
to create two utility functions. These functions will be
**findWinner** and **areAllBoxesClicked**.

Description:

1. The findWinner will contain an array with winning combinations and for loop.

   The for loop will iterate over the array with winning combinations and check
   if the game board contains winning combination. If so, it will return the winner,
   either ‘x’ or ‘o’. Otherwise, it will do nothing. 
 
2. The **areAllBoxesClicked** will use forEach loop to iterate over all
boxes count those that are not empty (not null).

3. If the number of these not empty (not null) boxes is equal to 9, 
it will return true-all boxes are click (filled). Otherwise, it will return false.

  See you in the next Challenge
