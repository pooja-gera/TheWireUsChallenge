## Building a Todo List using Hooks in React - Deleting the added items

In this task you will use CSS, JavaScript and React to build a To-Do List.

### Challenge Description
1. Create a ToDoList.js file and add the return li part to the ToDoList component. __You will need to use props to do this.__
2. After the item has been added it doesnt dissappear from the input field. To do that, set the state of input back to empty after the item has been added to the array of items.
3. The list-item that appear should have a cross 'x' next to them of red colour which will act as a delete button in the next task.
