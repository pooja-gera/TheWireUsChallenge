**TicTacToe-Part4**

All Charged up to continue !! Hope you are done with the previous one.

In this challenge you need to complete the **The App component**.

The last component we need to create is the main App. 

**Description:**

1. Here, we will import Board and Scoreboard components/views we just
created. We can also import CSS (or Sass) stylesheets to make our 
Tic Tac Toe game look better. 

2. However, the most important part of this component will
be implementing BrowserRouter and Routes from react-router-dom.

We will use the router to create two routes, one for root (homepage) 
and one for the Tic Tac Toe game board. Root route will render the Scoreboard
component. The board route will render Board component. As the last step
we will render the App component into DOM.

See you in the next Challenge
