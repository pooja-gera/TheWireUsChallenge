## useState in Hooks ##

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. In case you want to add a state to function component then instead of changing it to a class component you can use Hooks. <br/><br/>

#### Challenge Description ###

1. Create a function component Clicked in Clicked.js.
2. Import the necessary modules to change state in React using Hooks.
