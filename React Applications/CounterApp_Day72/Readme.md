## Day 72

**Counter App -A small shopping cart **

This tiny application is like adding,removing,deleting, resetting products 
which reflects in the total number of products into our shopping cart.

In the few Challenges from now, we will create a shopping cart.

**Challenge Hints-**

1. Run the basic installation commands and set up the folders (command-npx create-react-app calculator).

2. Create a class coomponent app.js and initialise state value to  counters: [ { id: 1, value: 0 },
                                                                               { id: 2, value: 0 },
                                                                               { id: 3, value: 0 },
                                                                               { id: 4, value: 0 } 
3. Now define functions to increment ,decrement , reset ,delete and  restart the value of counter .

4. Render it and return by calling all the function.
                                                                               
Rest we will go in the next challenge...
