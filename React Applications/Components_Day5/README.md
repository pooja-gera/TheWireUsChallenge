## Components in React ##

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and returns HTML via a render function.
Example: While making a website instead of adding HTML code of header/navbar again and again, you can use React to make the website. Using React, just make a Navbar/ Header component and render that component on diferent pages(like Home, About Us page etc.) of your website.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.
