Hello guys!!!
I hope everyone is doing great, even if someone is not DO NOT hesitate to ask anything at all from the mentors.

So, you must have heard about different libraries of python and you guys did learn about numpy, pandas etc.
So here is the fun library, have you guys ever thought about fetching the data from different sites on the internet? I am sure yes.

So here is another amazing and fun library to learn for ya'all.
This is known as urllib.
If you haven't heard about this library you can check it out at 
https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html

So the task is very simple 
1. You need to import the necessary libraries.
2. Then you need to open any url and print it.
3. Then you need to right a command to parse the values into the url.

What is URL parsing?
URL parsing is a function of traffic management and load-balancing products that scan URLs to determine how to forward traffic across different links or into different servers. A URL includes a protocol identifier (http, for Web traffic) and a resource name, such as www.microsoft.com.

ALL THE BEST!!!
