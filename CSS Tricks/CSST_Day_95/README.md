# Tailwind Divide property

Whenever we add any line breaker, we can add color to the line that is visibe. We can even make it dashed
or increase or decrease the opacity as well.

Tailwind supports us to do so.
Lets see some of the properties:

Control the border color between elements using the divide-{color} utilities.

Control the opacity of borders between elements using the .divide-opacity-{amount} utilities.

Control the border style between elements using the divide-{style} utilities.


Responsive
To control the borders between elements at a specific breakpoint, add a {screen}: prefix to any existing divide utility. 
For example, adding the class md:divide-x-8 to an element would apply the divide-x-8 utility at medium screen sizes and above.


In this challenge you have to work on how to create border colors and linebreaker style:

1.Use Color property
2. Use Opacity property
3. Use style property

 Hint: Use Tailwind documentation
