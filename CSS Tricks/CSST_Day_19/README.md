# The next challenge is on Tool-Tips.
## CSS tooltip refers to a popup message that appears after a mouse hover, or when elements get keyboard focus. It disappears on mouse out, or when the element loses keyboard focus.

So, have you seen text popping out whenever you hover over the web-page's name(try now and hover over the tab that you have opened).

So,this you would be making. You need to include some of the below:
1. data-text
2. content
3. hover before and after effects
4. display property-inline
5. Visibility property
