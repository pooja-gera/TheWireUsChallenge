# This is an interesting challenge!!
  ## This is we are gonna incorporate typewriter effect!!!

You might know , what a typewriter is and how it works: It's the same writing machine in which one text appeares dynamically after the other. 
Also, the blinking cursor .
So, you have to create typewriter effect and a blinking cursor.

Challenge requirements are:

1. To ensure that each character has the same width and to make the transition between letters feel like being physically typed, set the font-family property to “monospace”.
2. Use the letter-spacing to define the space between letters and add a margin.
3. Set the overflow property to its “hidden” value to hide the content, which exceeds the width of the element.
4. Prevent the text from splitting into two lines by using the white-space property with the “nowrap” value.
5. Add the border-right property. That will be a blinking cursor at the end of the text. The blinking effect will be created by applying animation    to our border.
6. Add animation with the animation property. You are free to choose the length of time and the number of steps.
7. Define keyframes for the animation. The first one will be for the typing, another one for the cursor.
