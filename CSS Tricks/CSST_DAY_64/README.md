# Group of Input powered Buttons

In this challenge we will learn about creating group of input powered buttons.
Here you need to create a group of 6-8 buttons.


The .btn classes are designed to be used with the <button> element. 
However, you can also use these classes on <a> or <input> elements.  
To provide button, toggling effect, add data-toggle="buttons" to a .btn-group 
containing those modified buttons to enable their toggling behavior via JavaScript 
and add .btn-group-toggle to style the <input>s within your buttons.
