# Bending Animation

Before knowing bending effect, you must clearly know about animation:

An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

What are keyframes:?

When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, 
the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.

So, in bending effect, you have to choose any one aobject and perform strict animations in it. Use z-component in transforma and transition areas.
This is quite challenging task.

In this you have to create a 3D bending or flip animation. Like, opening or closing of door , book or flip of a book.

Code requirements:

1. Use animation property
2. use span in html
3. use transform property
4. use animation delay
5. use keyframes
5. use z-index(most important)
