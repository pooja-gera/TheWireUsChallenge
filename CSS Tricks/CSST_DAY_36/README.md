# Dropdown Menu
In this challenge you are required to create a navigation bar with drop-down menu. Use position properties of CSS. A drop-down menu is a menu that offers a list of options. The title of the menu, or the currently-selected item in the list, is always displayed. When the visible item is clicked, other items from the list "drop down" into view, and the user can choose from those options.

Requirements for the challenge:
1) Create at least 3 drop down fields in the bar.
2) You can make it left align or center align as per your choice.
3) You can also try creating a dropdown menu inside one of the fields in the drop down list.
