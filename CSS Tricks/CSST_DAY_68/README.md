# Align images and text using media objects

In this challenge we will learn about aligning images and text using media objects. 
Create a container and divide it into two parts on the left add an image and on the right side add a paragraph/text.


Only two classes are requiredâ€”the wrapping .media and the .media-body around your 
content. Optional padding and margin can be controlled through spacing utilities.
