# BUTTON GRADIENT

In this challenge you will learn about color-gradient methods. A color gradient specifies a range of position-dependent colors, usually used to fill a region. It produces a three-dimensional color look by blending one color into another. Multiple colors can be used, where one color gradually fades and changes to the other color. 
A linear color gradient is specified by two points and a color at each point. The starting point is the location on the gradient line where the first color begins. The ending point is the point where the last color ends. There can be many in between, optional color-stop points also. 
A radial gradient is specified as a circle that has one color at the edge and another at the center...

Requirements for the challenge are as follows:

For Button 1: Use custom or simple linear gradient method.

For Button 2: Use circular or radial gradient method.

For Button 3: Change the default gradient style from (top to bottom) to (left to right). 

For Button 4: Change default style from (top to bottom) to (right to left)
