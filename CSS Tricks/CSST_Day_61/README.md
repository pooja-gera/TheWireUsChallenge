# Bootstrap cards

You have already worked on how to create a profile card using CSS. 
You inserted images, texts, buttons etc.

But again if you go back and see, how lengthy the code was. Bootstrap removes all this tediousness. 
Now you can use simple bootstrap library and framework to add cards of your own choice.

In this challenge you have to make bootstrap cards.

1. Inculcate header
2. Footer
3. Links
4. Borders
5. Outlines

All the above mentioned tasks can be simply inserted using bootstrap few lines of code.
However, you cannot simply copy the code.

Use bootstrap for customizing the code, never to copy.
