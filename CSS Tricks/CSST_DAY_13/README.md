FLEX-BOX:
In this challenge we will learn about Flex-box. The Flexbox Layout aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.


In this challenge you are required to create 2 containers:

1)For the first container:
1.1)Keep containerâ€™s width around 400px.
1.2)Create 5-6 boxes of width 100px each inside the container.
1.3)Wrap boxes in the container. The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked.
