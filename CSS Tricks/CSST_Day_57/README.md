# BOOTSRATP Caption Using Figures

This is again a simple challenge, in which firstly you will have to insert an image of your choice to the website
and then, you need to caption the image.

You can add a single caption or multiple captions in any direction of your choice.

In this challenge you have to write caption for the images.
1.It should be in middle
2.Should be left or right.

Advice: I strongly suggest you to first work on CSS and then use bootstrap for above challenge. 
This will help you to brush-up and horn your skills and basics.
