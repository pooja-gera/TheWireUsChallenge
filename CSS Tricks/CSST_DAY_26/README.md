# Cube
In this challenge we will learn about 3d transform properties of css. 3D transforms are applied via the same -webkit-transform property as 2D transforms. For example, hereâ€™s how to rotate an element about the Y (vertical) axis: There are several new transform functions available for use in the -webkit-transform property: Move the element in x, y and z, and just move the element in z. Positive z is towards the viewer.The rotate functions rotate the element around the corresponding axis. This is a bit counter-intuitive at first, as you might imagine that rotateX() will rotate an object horizontally left or right. Instead, using rotateX() rotates an element around the horizontal X axis, so the top of the element angles back and away, and the bottom angles near.



Requirements for the challenge:
1)You are required to create cube.
2)The cube must be rotating.
3)Place it in the center horizontally and vertically both.
4)You can use transforming properties of CSS.
5)fill the faces of the cube with beautiful colors.
