# In this challenge we will learn a new concept in CSS.

## The cubic-bezier() function is an inbuilt function in CSS which is used to defines a Cubic Bezier curve.

A Bezier curve is a mathematically defined curve used in two-dimensional graphic applications like abode illustrator, inkscape etc.
The curve is defined by four points: the initial position and the terminating position i.e P0 and P3 respectively (which are called “anchors”) and two separate middle points
i.e P1 and P2(which are called “handles”) in our example.Bezier curves are frequently used in computer graphics, animation, modeling etc.

The cubic-bezier() function can be used with the animation-timing-function property and the transition-timing-function property.
You can add animation in your websites using this function. The timing function helps to add timings with which particular function will run after a specific time interval.

Task for this challenge is:
1. Study on cubic-bezier() function
2. Make a heading within borders and give background color
3. Use hover effects for increasing or decreasing the width of box
4. Use transition-timing-function and transition property in css file
5. Bring difference to your work by incorporating box-shadow and text-align properties
