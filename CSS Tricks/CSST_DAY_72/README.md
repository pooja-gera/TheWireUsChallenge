# Align Items Vertically using Bootstrap

In this challenge we will learn about flex-box utilities. 
Apply display utilities to create a flexbox container and 
transform direct children elements into flex items. Flex 
containers and items are able to be modified further with 
additional flex properties. Use align-items utilities on 
flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items 
on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if flex-direction: column). 
Choose from start, end, center, baseline, or stretch.
