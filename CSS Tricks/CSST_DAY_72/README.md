# Align Items Vertically using Bootstrap

In this challenge we will learn about flex-box utilities.
You have to create 3-large containers each containing 4-5 boxes. Align these boxes at center, end and start of the container vertically. 

Apply display utilities to create a flexbox container and 
transform direct children elements into flex items.

Flex containers and items are able to be modified further with 
additional flex properties.

Use align-items utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items 
on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if flex-direction: column). 

Choose from start, end, center, baseline, or stretch.
