# SCSS At rules

uch of Sassâ€™s extra functionality comes in the form of new at-rules it adds on top of CSS:

@use loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together.

@forward loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins, functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the @use rule.

@import extends the CSS at-rule to load styles, mixins, functions, and variables from other stylesheets.

@mixin and @include makes it easy to re-use chunks of styles.

@function defines custom functions that can be used in SassScript expressions.

@debug prints a message for debugging purposes.

Flow control rules like @if, @each, @for, and @while control whether or how many times styles are emitted.

Sass also has some special behavior for plain CSS at-rules: they can contain interpolation, and they can be nested in style rules. Some of them, like @media and @supports, also allow SassScript to be used directly in the rule itself without interpolation.

In this challenge you have to work on how:
1.To use @use

2.To use @forward

3.To use @import

4.To use @mixin

5.To use @include

6.To use @function
