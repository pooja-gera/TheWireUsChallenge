# Progress bars using Bootstrap

In this challenge we will learn about progress bars. For this we use the .progress as a wrapper to indicate 
the max value of the progress bar and inner .progress-bar to indicate the progress so far. Add .progress-bar-striped to 
any .progress-bar to apply a stripe via CSS gradient over the progress barâ€™s background color. The striped gradient can 
also be animated. Add .progress-bar-animated to .progress-bar to animate the stripes right to left via CSS3 animations.
