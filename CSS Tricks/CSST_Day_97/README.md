# Box shadow

Various shadow properties are provided by tailwind. You have studied it using simple css as well.

Some of them are:

Outer shadow
Use the .shadow-xs, .shadow-sm, .shadow, .shadow-md, .shadow-lg, .shadow-xl, or .shadow-2xl utilities to apply
 different sized outer box shadows to an element.

Inner shadow
Use the .shadow-inner utility to apply a subtle inset box shadow to an element.
 This can be useful for things like form controls or wells.

Focus outline shadow
Use the .shadow-outline utility to apply a focus-ring-style shadow to an element.

Responsive
To control the shadow of an element at a specific breakpoint, add a {screen}: 
prefix to any existing shadow utility. For example, use md:shadow-lg to apply the 
shadow-lg utility at only medium screen sizes and above. This can be useful when combined with
 .focus:outline-none to create a better looking focus style that follows an element's border radius.


In this challenge simply add Shadow to your boxes  :

1.Implement with various sizes shadow options
2.Work on outer and inner shadow also(in the box)
