# Bootstrap Containers

In this challenge we will learn about three more bootstrap classes 
namely .container, .container-fluid and .jumbotron. You have to create 
two jumbotron and use .container and .container-fluid classes in it.


Jumbotron is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend
the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site.
Whereas, .container, sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint. 
And .container-fluid, sets width: 100% at all breakpoints.
