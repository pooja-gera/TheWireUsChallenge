2)The max-width and margin utilities to constrain the card width and center it horizontally

3)The background color, border radius, and box-shadow utilities style the card's appearance

4)The width and height utilities to size the logo image

5)The margin and padding utilities to position the card text

6)The font size, text color, and line-height utilities to style the card text.
