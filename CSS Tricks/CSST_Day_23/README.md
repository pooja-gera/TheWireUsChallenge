# Grayscale Filter
## In this you will apply another filter on image besides blur filter.
This is called grayscale filter. It converts the image to grayscale.

0% (0) is default and represents the original image.
100% will make the image completely gray (used for black and white images).
Negative values are not allowed.

Hint: Use filter function in CSS!!
