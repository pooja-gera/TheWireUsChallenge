# Visibility Helpers

These are basically the filters that are used to show/hide content depending on the width of the viewport.

Again a simple challenge, in where you have to work on visibility filters

 and see which text will appear in which viewport.

1. Write texts for all viewports 
2. see which one do you see now.
3. Simply refer to the syntax of bulma and implement it using one single line of code

 Hint: Use Bulma documentation
