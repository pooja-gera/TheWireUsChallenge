# Responsive Typography helpers

In this challenge we are going to learn about responsive typography helpers of bulma. They help in changing size, weight, and other font properties of the text.
For this you have to create a container with heading and some text.
The heading must be left aligned for larger screen and become centrally aligned for smaller screen. Whereas the text size should increase for smaller resolutions. 

Responsive size
You can choose a specific size for each viewport width. You simply need to append the viewport width to the size modifier.
For example, is-size-1-mobile etc


Responsive Alignment
You can align text differently for each viewport width. Simply append the viewport width to the alignment modifier.
For example, has-text-left-mobile etc
