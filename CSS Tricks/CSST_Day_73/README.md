# SCSS Declarations

In Sass as in CSS, property declarations define how elements that match a selector are styled. 
But Sass adds extra features to make them easier to write and to automate. 
First and foremost, a declaration's value can be any SassScript expression, which will be evaluated and included in the result.


In this challenge you have to work on how:
1.To do nesting and utilize it
2.To use hidden declarations
3.To use custom props

Hint: Use SCSS documentation!
