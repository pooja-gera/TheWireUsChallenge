# In this challenge, we will study new concept of responsive media queries.

Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

For example:
If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

We can also add breakpoint to our websites using this. This basically allows you to align the contents in the manner you wish to: on different viewports. 

Things go as:

1. Try to change row size for differnt screens
2. Do the same for columns
3. Change font-size using media queries
4. Input different images and adjust the indentation according to screen size.

Try one among all mentioned above. More than one is from your personal choice and learning.

So, referring to this, you have create and use media queries on your own!!
