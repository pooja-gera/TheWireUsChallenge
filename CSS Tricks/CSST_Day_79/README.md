# SCSS Built-in-modules

Sass provides the following built-in modules:

The sass:math module provides functions that operate on numbers.

The sass:string module makes it easy to combine, search, or split apart strings.

The sass:color module generates new colors based on existing ones, making it easy to build color themes.

The sass:list module lets you access and modify values in lists.

The sass:map module makes it possible to look up the value associated with a key in a map, and much more.

The sass:selector module provides access to Sass’s powerful selector engine.

The sass:meta module exposes the details of Sass’s inner workings.

These modules can be loaded with the @use rule like any user-defined stylesheet, and their functions can be called like any other module member. All built-in module URLs begin with sass: to indicate that they're part of Sass itself.

In this challenge you have to work on simple scss modules and implement in the code:

1.color

2.list

3.math

4.map
