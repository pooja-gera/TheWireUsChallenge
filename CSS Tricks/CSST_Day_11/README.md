# This is the next and intersting challenge on flexbox-making.
## Flexbox is also called a flexible box model.
It is basically a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within container.
The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, 
and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.

How to use:
When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the main axis and the cross axis. 
The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. 
Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.

In your first challenge on flexbox:

Use properties of:
1.flex-direction: row
row-reverse
column
column-reverse

2.justify-content(The justify-content property is used to align the flex items). It can be:
center
flex-start
flex-end
space-around
space-between

Since it is a new concept first read about it and then go for implemntation:

Make it as attractive as you can!
