# Animated glowing Snow-Fall
In this challenge you are required to create animated snow-fall. The working principle for this is as follows:

The falling snow consists of three main elements: the image itself, the animation layer, and the wrapper.
The image is a regular img HTML tag that is used to show an image beneath the animation layer. It also stretches the wrapper, which defines borders for the animation layer.
The animation layer consists of three sub-layers where each sub-layer has a background with a semi-transparent image of a snow pattern. Every sub-layer has a different snow pattern image with small, medium and large snowflakes.



1)You can use animation properties of CSS. 
2)Also I have attached 3 images for 3 different layers of snow. Feel free to use them.
