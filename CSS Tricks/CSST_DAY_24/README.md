# FROSTED GLASS EFFECT WITH CSS FILTERS:

In this challenge you are required to display frosted effect on any image of your choice.The idea behind the effect is relatively simple: just blur and lighten the area where you want this effect. The content gains higher contrast with its background, but you still maintain a rough idea of whatâ€™s going on behind it. 

Requirements for the challenge:
1) Add a background image of your choice on the webpage.
2) Apply frosted effect on any part of the image.
3) You can also add text over the image.
