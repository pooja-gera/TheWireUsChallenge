# ALIGN ELEMENTS WITH STATIC POSITION USING calc()
Here you will learn about static positioning. The position property can help you manipulate the location of an element. Every element has a static position by default, so the element will stick to the normal page flow. So if there is a left/right/top/bottom/z-index set then there will be no effect on that element.
We can set the position with the help of calc() function.
