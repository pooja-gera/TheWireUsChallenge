FLEX-BOX:
In this challenge we will use two more properties of flex box namely flex-flow and align content.
The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap. Whereas the align-content property modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex items, it aligns flex lines.
