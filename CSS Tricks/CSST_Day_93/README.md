# Tailwind Grids

Grids are simple horizontal and verical box like structures.
Tailwind supports both basic and responsive patterns.

Basic Grids
Use the existing Flexbox and percentage width utilities to construct basic grids.

Responsive Grids
Use the responsive variants of the width utilities to build responsive grid layouts.

Mixed Column Sizes
Mix different percentage width utilities to build mixed size grids.


Column Spacing
Add a negative horizontal margin like -mx-2 to your column container and an equal horizontal padding like px-2 to each column to add gutters.

To prevent horizontal scrolling in full width layouts, add overflow-hidden to another parent container, or compensate for the negative margin with matching horizontal padding.

Simple Offsets
Use auto margin utilities like ml-auto and mr-auto to offset columns in a row.
