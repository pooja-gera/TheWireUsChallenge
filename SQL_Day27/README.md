## SQL Challenge: Types of Triangle  

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- *Equilateral*: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
- *Isosceles*: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
- *Scalene*: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
- *Not A Triangle*: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides
