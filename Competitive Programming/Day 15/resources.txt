Hey Again!

We have a code snippet to help you through.

// Function to print even length binary sequences 
    // whose sum of first and second half bits is same 
   
    // diff --> difference between sums of first n bits 
    // and last n bits 
    // out --> output array 
    // start --> starting index 
    // end --> ending index 
    static void findAllSequences(int diff, char out[],  
                                     int start, int end) 
    { 
        // We can't cover difference of more  
        // than n with 2n bits 
        if (Math.abs(diff) > (end - start + 1) / 2) 
            return; 
   
        // if all bits are filled 
        if (start > end) 
        { 
            // if sum of first n bits and 
            // last n bits are same 
            if (diff == 0) 
            { 
                System.out.print(out); 
                System.out.print(" "); 
            }     
            return; 
        } 
   
        // fill first bit as 0 and last bit as 1 
        out[start] = '0'; 
        out[end] = '1'; 
        findAllSequences(diff + 1, out, start + 1, end - 1); 
   
        // fill first and last bits as 1 
        out[start] = out[end] = '1'; 
        findAllSequences(diff, out, start + 1, end - 1); 
   
        // fill first and last bits as 0 
        out[start] = out[end] = '0'; 
        findAllSequences(diff, out, start + 1, end - 1); 
   
        // fill first bit as 1 and last bit as 0 
        out[start] = '1'; 
        out[end] = '0'; 
        findAllSequences(diff - 1, out, start + 1, end - 1); 
    } 

Happy Coding!
