Simply the counting
Let l be the LCA of u, v. We want to count the number of pairs of nodes (w,t) with its path move list being same as path move list for u, v.

Instead of counting a pair of vertices, what if we count just the number of vertices which can be the potential lowest common ancestors.
If we fix the lca L of the pair of nodes, then the corresponding pair of vertices w, t will be unique for this L due to the constraint that of path move list for w, t should be same u, v should be same. Let us see the way of finding w, t for a fix L.

We can find w in the following way.
First find the list of moves for moving from LCA(u, v) to u. For this, we first find the list of moves from u to LCA(u,v) by keep on moving to parent till we reach the LCA(u, v) node. The list of moves for moving from LCA(u,v) to u, will be reverse of this move list.
Now we apply the exact same list of moves starting from vertex L, the vertex at the end will be the vertex w.

Similarly, we can find the vertex t too.

def find(x, u, L)
	list = get_list_of_moves(u, L)
	reverse list
	return apply(x, list);
    
w = find(x, u, L)
t = find(x, v, L) 

Now solve the original problem
Now, we just need to count number of LCA nodes L such that both the corresponding (w,t)≤n.

Let us defined a binary function valid(L) denoting whether the (w,t) corresponding to this node L are both less than or equal to nn.
Notice that if we go over L from 1 to n,
Notice that function valid(x) is a monotonic function. It will be of following kind T,T,T…,F,F,F,…, where T denotes true and F denotes false.
In simple terms, if valid(L)valid(L) is false, then there won’t exist some L'>L such that valid(L) is true for it, i.e. once valid(L) becomes false, it will always remain false.

def valid(x):
	find w, t as stated before.
	return w <= n and t <= n
This observation enables us to use binary search over L. The range of binary search will be L from 1 to n.

int lo = 1, hi = n, ans = 0;
while (lo <= hi) {
	int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
	if (valid(x)) {
		ans = mid;
		lo = mid + 1;
	} else {
		hi = mid - 1;
	}
}

Time complexity
Time complexity of the algorithm will be O((log n)^2). One logn for binary searching, other logn for valid function.
