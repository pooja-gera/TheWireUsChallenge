Let's binary search for the answer, and we will focus on evaluating our possible function quickly.

Algorithm
We will use a sliding window approach to count the number of pairs with distance <= guess.
For every possible right, we maintain the loop invariant: left is the smallest value such that nums[right] - nums[left] <= guess. Then, the number of pairs with right as it's right-most endpoint is right - left, and we add all of these up.
