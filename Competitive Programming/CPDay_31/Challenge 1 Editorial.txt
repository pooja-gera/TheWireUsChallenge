The key observation is: if for some index i, ai≠ai−1, then bi must be equal to ai−1, since it's the only way to even change the prefix MEX. We can use this observation to fill some indices of b. Now, how do we fill the rest? Let's start by avoiding every element in a. Something special will happen if we avoid using any element from a again. If we look at the first i numbers in b, ai will indeed be excluded, so MEX(b1,b2,…,bi)≤ai. Now we need to make it as big as possible. How do we make it as big as possible? The logical thing to do is to fill the rest of b with the numbers not in a in increasing order. It turns out this construction always satisfies the conditions. Indeed, if we look at the first i elements in b, every element less than ai will be present because ai≤i and we added the rest of the elements in increasing order.
