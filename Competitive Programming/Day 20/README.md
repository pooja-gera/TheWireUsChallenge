Hey Techies!

How awesome was our childhood when we used to scribble some data handling questions and found them the easiest.Keeping this in mind,we bring to you a coding question on the same lines 'HISTOGRAM'.
You have to find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars.

Example:-
For n=5{1,2,3,,4,5}

P.S :Take reference from the histogram picture document enclosed along.

We see there that a histogram with the above mentioned values has been created .
Now,the largest rectangle can be obtained of breadth=3 and length=3. Its starting index is 2 and ending index is 4 and it has a height of 3. 
Hence area = 3*3 = 9


So let's get working on it!!
