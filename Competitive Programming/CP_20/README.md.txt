Hey coders!

Given a number n, our task is to find all 1 to n bit numbers with no consecutive 1s in their binary representation.

Examples:

Input : n = 4
Output : 1 2 4 5 8 9 10
These are numbers with 1 to 4
bits and no consecutive ones in
binary representation.

Input : n = 3
Output : 1 2 4 5

Happy coding!!
