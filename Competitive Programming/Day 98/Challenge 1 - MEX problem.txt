Given an array a of length n, find another array, b, of length n such that:

for each i (1≤i≤n) MEX({b1, b2, …, bi})=ai.
The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't belong to this set.

If such array doesn't exist, determine this.

Input
The first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤10^5) — the length of the array a.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, …, an (0≤ai≤i) — the elements of the array a. It's guaranteed that ai≤a{i+1} for 1≤i<n.

Output
If there's no such array, print a single line containing −1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing n integers b1, b2, …, bn (0≤bi≤10^6)
If there are multiple answers, print any.

Examples
Input:
3
1 2 3
Output:
0 1 2 

Input:
4
0 0 0 2
Output:
1 3 4 0 

Input:
3
1 1 3
Output:
0 2 1 

Note
In the second test case, other answers like [1,1,1,0], for example, are valid.
