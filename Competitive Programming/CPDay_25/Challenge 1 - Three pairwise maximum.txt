You are given three positive (i.e. strictly greater than zero) integers x, y and z.

Your task is to find positive integers a, b and c such that x=max(a,b), y=max(a,c) and z=max(b,c), or determine that it is impossible to find such a, b and c.

You have to answer t independent test cases. Print required a, b and c in any (arbitrary) order.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤2⋅10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains three integers x, y, and z (1≤x,y,z≤10^9).

Output
For each test case, print the answer:

"NO" in the only line of the output if a solution doesn't exist;
or "YES" in the first line and any valid triple of positive integers a, b and c (1≤a,b,c≤10^9) in the second line. You can print a, b and c in any order.

Example
Input:
5
3 2 3
100 100 100
50 49 49
10 30 20
1 1000000000 1000000000

Output:
YES
3 2 1
YES
100 100 100
NO
