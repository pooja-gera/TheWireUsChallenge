Trailing zeros
Your task is to find minimal natural number N, so that N! contains exactly Q zeroes on the trail in decimal notation. As you know N!=1∗2∗...∗N. For example, 5! = 120, 120 contains one zero on the trail.

Input
The only line contains one number Q (0≤Q≤108), representing the number of trailing zeros.

Output
In the only line print "No solution", if there is no such number N, and N otherwise.
