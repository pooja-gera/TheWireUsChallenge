## Left Rotations on Array
## DAY EIGHT
## Challenge Master - Chetna Gola

Hey coders!!

A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. 

Given an array of n integers and a number, , perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format
5 4
1 2 3 4 5

Output
5 1 2 3 4

Explanation
When we perform d=4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

[1,2,3,4,5]->[2,3,4,5,1]->[3,4,5,1,2]->[4,5,1,2,3]->[5,1,2,3,4]

Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated values, which is 5 1 2 3 4.
