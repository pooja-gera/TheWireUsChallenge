Hey !

So now to help you go about this question,we have hints for you.

Doing this the same old way , teh complexity of the code increases.Hence we would consider our solution by using recursion.

Step1: 
public static String Formatredundancy(String a,int index,String result)
//String return type ensures that the function returns the resultant string, result(which will be empty at the start)
//We pass our intial string and also the index number to point out the checking on current character

Step 2:
if(//check if the previous character == current character)
{ append into your result string a star 
}
else
{append the current character into the result string
}

Step 3:
Give a recursive call to the function but this time implement the index by 1.

After the string is completely traversed,return the result to the main function.
