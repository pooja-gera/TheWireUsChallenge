## Convert a string into a string that contains the character and the count of characters
## DAY SIX
## Challenge Master - Chetna Gola

Hey Coders!

New Day,New question.

Take an input S, a string. Write a function that does string compression. String compression means, you have to count the number of occurrences in a particular string, and instead of repeating the character that many times, you write the character next to its frequency in the string.
Print the value returned.

Example:
Input :“aaabbccds” 
Output : a3b2c2ds

Let's get started!
