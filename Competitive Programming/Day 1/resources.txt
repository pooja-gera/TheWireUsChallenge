Now there's a really easy solution for this problem statement.
Let's hint it out for you (pseudocode)

Step1:Check for row number in which you have to traverse from top to bottom
         Hence check for odd numbered row.
         for(i=1;i<=4;i++)
          { if(i%2!=0)
                   { //Print that column elements from top to bottom }
Step2:            else //For even numbered row
                  { //Print column elements from bottom to top}
             }


Did you get it?
