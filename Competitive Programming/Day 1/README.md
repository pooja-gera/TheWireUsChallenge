## Column Wise Traversal of a 2D Array 
## DAY ONE 
## Challenge Master - Chetna Gola 

What if you want to do playful problems to ease up minds? Sounds fun,right?

Lets just take a 2D array and try traversing it, but this time let's make it a column wise traversal.
Example:
    11  12  13  14
    21  22  23  24
    31  32  33  34
    41  42  43  44

For this we need a code which can tranverse this matrix in a columnar way and also in a contiguous manner.

Output:
11,21,31,41,42,32,22,12,13,23,33,43,44,34,24,14,END

We now can simply check for our row number once we reach the limits of this matrix and then accordingly decide for our next move.

LET'S GET STARTED TECHIES!!!!
