It can be observed that all the pairs are formed when the second number (y) is entirely made of digit 9

We have to find the total number of y that can be formed with only 9
The answer to that is [Log10(N+1)] i.e the integer value of Log10(N+1)

Log10(N) gives us the total number of digits in N minus 1.
Using (N+1) takes care of the cases where y is made of 9
Eg: 9999 becomes 10000 so [Log10(N+1)] gives us 4, so we include 9999 in the list

So the total number of numbers that can be formed with the only digit 9 is
[Log10(N+1)]

Let D=[Log10(N+1)]
All the numbers up to N can be paired with D numbers
Therefore, the total number of pairs is x * D

The unique pairs are all the values of x up to N

Therefore;
The unique values of x would be M
The total number of pairs would be M * D
