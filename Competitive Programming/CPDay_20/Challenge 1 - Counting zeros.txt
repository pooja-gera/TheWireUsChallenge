You are given an array of N integers(Indexed at 1)

For the given array you have to answer some queries given later.The queries are of 2 types:

1)TYPE 1 -> 1 L R (where L and R are integers)
For this query you have to calculate the product of elements of the array in the range L to R (both inclusive) and print the number of zeros at the end of the result.

2)TYPE 2-> 0 L R V (where L,R,V are integers)

For this query you have to set the value of all the elements in the array ranging from L to R (both inclusive) to V.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space seperated integers denoting the elements of the array.
The third line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
The next Q lines contain the details of the queries which can be of TYPE-1 or TYPE-2.
 
Output
In the output each line must contain the result for the query of TYPE-1 that is the number of zeroes at the end of the result. 

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
0 ≤ array[i] ≤ 1000000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
0 ≤ V ≤ 1000000
 

Example
Input:
5
1 3 5 8 9
3
1 2 5
0 1 4 10
1 1 5

Output:
1
4

 

Explanation
For the first query answer is 3*5*8*9=1080 that is 1 zero at the end
After the second query the array becomes 10 10 10 10 9
For the third query the answer is 10*10*10*10*9=90000 that is 4 zeros at the end
