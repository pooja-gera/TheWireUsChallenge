Just simulate whatever is said!
Letâ€™s say the loss in income for Naman is given by the variable lossloss.
For every element in the array Pi, the price at which it will be sold at is max(Pi, K). (think why?)
Thus, for every element i, loss = loss + (Pi - max(Pi,K))

The complexity for this solution is O(N), as for every i, we only do a max operation, and a subtraction.
