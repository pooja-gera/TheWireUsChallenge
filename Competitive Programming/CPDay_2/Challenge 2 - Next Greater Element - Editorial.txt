What does next greater element means?
The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.
These kind of algorithms are very common to start with competitive programming

Here's a naive solution (pseudocode)

array res, input
for i=1..N:
    int curr = input[i]
    found = false
    for j=i+1..N:
	if input[j] > curr --> found = true and res[i] = input[j] and break;
    if found == false res[i] = -1

It simply goes to every possible subarray it can travel to. Unfortunately, this is slow; it runs in O(N^2) time, and for N = 10^5 this will not pass time limit.

Let us look at a better solution now!

In this approach we have started iterating from the last element(nth) to the first(1st) element
The benefit is that when we arrive at a certain index his next greater element will be already in stack and we can directly get this element while at the same index.
After reaching a certain index we will pop the stack till we get the greater element on top from the current element and that element will be the answer for current element
If stack gets empty while doing the pop operation then the answer would be -1
Then we will stored the answer in an array for the current index.

Here's the pseudocode

stack <int> s //Initializing stack
vector res //Generating answer

for i=N..1
    if (!s.empty() and s.top() <= input[i]) /// Popping till we get greater element of top or stack gets empty.
	s.pop();
    
    if(s.empty()) res[i] = -1 ///No greater element found 
    else res[i] = s.top() //Top element greater than current
    s.push(input[i])
return res

Tada!
