Hey Coders!!

Reverse a satck using recursion and do not use any extra stack.

Example:

Input:
{First line contains an integer N (size of the stack).
Next N lines follow each containing an integer to be stored in the stack where the last integer is at the top of the stack}
3//number of elements
3
2
1

Output:
1
2
3
