Hey Coders !!

So here's your new question.....

There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings.

For example:
Input:
4 //Number of input strings
aba
baba
aba
xzxb
3 //Number of query strings
aba
xzxb
ab

Output:
1
0
1

Explanation:
Here, "aba" occurs twice, in the first and third string. The string "xzxb" occurs once in the fourth string, and "ab" does not occur at all.

Let's get started!!
