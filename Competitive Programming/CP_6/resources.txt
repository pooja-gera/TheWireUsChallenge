So after reading the problem statement,there might be many solutions in your mind.But let's explore the easiest way(recursion)

Input :
xab3.14xx3.15x

Step 1:
public static String Removepi(String initial,int index,String result)
//Return type is string to recieve the last ans(output ) as string
//index number tells your current position in your initial string

Step 2:
check if the current character and previous character of the string 'initial' sum up to the word 'pi'
if(they do sum up)
{ simply append the string "3.14" to the resultant string
}
else
{append the previous character
}

Step 3:
Give a recursive call to the function but this time implement the count of index by 1

Step 4:
After traversing the entire string just return the value of resultant string to the main function

Output:
xabpixx3.15x
