To run the previous code we need to be clear of the question.
-> Every word in the sentence starts with a capital letter .
-> There is no special character in the sentence which needs special treatment.


One way of going about this question is:-

String s="IAmACompetitiveProgrammer";
if(//check for capital letters )
{ //if you find one change line and print it}
else
{//continue in the same line and keep on printing untill you encounter any capital letter} 


Did you get this one?
