Hey Again!!

We know that with practice you can solve huge problems and so we have a small code snippet which would help you learn the logic of this problem statement.

static int[] matchingStrings(String[] strings, String[] queries) //This function takes in 2 string arrays as input and returns an integer array
 {
      int c,k=0; //c is the counter for counting the number of matching strings 
      int a[]=new int[queries.length]; //Array is created to keep a count of all query string matches

      for(int i=0;i<queries.length;i++)
      {
          c=0;
          for(int j=0;j<strings.length;j++)
          if(queries[i].equals(strings[j])) //We check if query string is equal to the string we had input
          c++;
          a[k++]=c;
      }
      return a;
  }


Have a good time trying!!
