Binary search on data structure (containing all the top disk radii) to find the smallest top disk radius which the current disc can be placed on top of.

In total, youâ€™ll have three operations you want to handle: adding a new disc, binary searching for a disc and removing a disc.

Simulate the process, using the multiset. Be careful not to use a set because of duplicates being removed.
