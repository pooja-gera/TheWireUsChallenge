Challenge 1 - Naman and strings

There are N students standing in a row and numbered 1 through N from left to right. You are given a string S with length N, where for each valid i, the i-th character of S is 'x' if the i-th student is a girl or 'y' if this student is a boy. Students standing next to each other in the row are friends.

The students are asked to form pairs for a dance competition. Each pair must consist of a boy and a girl. Two students can only form a pair if they are friends. Each student can only be part of at most one pair. What is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed?

Input-
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.

Output-
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of pairs.

Constraints-
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤105
|S|=N
S contains only characters 'x' and 'y'
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Example Input
3
xy
xyxxy
yy

Example Output
1
2
0

Explanation
Example case 1: There is only one possible pair: (first student, second student).

Example case 2: One of the ways to form two pairs is: (first student, second student) and (fourth student, fifth student).

Another way to form two pairs is: (second student, third student) and (fourth student, fifth student).
