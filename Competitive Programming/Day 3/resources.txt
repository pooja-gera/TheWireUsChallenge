So now let's look into a little bit working of this question.

We all know about the explicit conversion of character to integer .This will come in handy now!
Here is a pseudocode to help you with your solution:
 
String s="acb"

Step 1:
char a=// store the first charcter of given string
char b=//store the second character of given string

Step 2:
//Change them to int 

Step 3:
int d=int (a)-int (b) //calculate their difference

Step 4:
Now append them into your result string after appending the previous string 

Repeat them  for all other characters too.

COME ON ,LET'S NOW WORK ON IT!!
