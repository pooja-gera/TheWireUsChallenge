The question can be modeled as an undirected graph
where each person is a node and
for each person, there is an undirected edge between
them and the person they like.

Then the question is simply reduced to finding the total number of connected components.
As the people in a particular polygon will always have some
direct/indirect connection amongst themselves

The no. of connected components can be found by simply
doing DFS from an unvisited node and marking all the reachable nodes as visited.
In a single DFS, all the nodes in a particular love polygon will be marked visited.
We can do this until all nodes have been visited.
