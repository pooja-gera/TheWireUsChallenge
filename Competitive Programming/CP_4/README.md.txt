Hey Coders!!

The first thing that was taught to us when we started with programming was how the computer just understands 0's and 1's and what are ASCII codes.
Getting back to the basics,here's a question where you have to write a program that inserts between each pair of characters the difference between their ascii codes and print the ans.
It's gonna be interesting to see how we code it.

Example:-
Let the string to be worked on be "acb"

Now our output should be 
a2c-1b

Explanation
For the sample case, the Ascii code of a=97 and c=99 ,the difference between c and a is 2.
Similarly ,the Ascii code of b=98 and c=99 and their difference is -1. So the ans is a2c-1b.

NOW LET'S GET STARTED!
