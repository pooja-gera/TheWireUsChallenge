Okay so let's start with python.

I am sure you guys have heard about python.
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

What is Python used for?
Python is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. That includes back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts among other things.

Why is Python so popular?
More Productive. First and foremost reason why Python is much popular because it is highly productive as compared to other programming languages like C++ and Java. ... Python is also very famous for its simple programming syntax, code readability and English-like commands that make coding in Python lot easier and efficient

Where is Python used today?
Python is used by Wikipedia, Google (where Van Rossum used to work), Yahoo!, CERN and NASA, among many other organisations. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient.

So, I am sure that you guys must be very excited to learn this amazing language. So, let's begin. 

Your task is to do the following questions and learn new and some amazing functions along with it.

1. Write a program to identify the datatypes of variables entered by the user.
2. Write a program to count number of digits in a number.
3. Create a lambda function to print cube of a number.
4. Write a program to use differnt string methods and functions.
5. Write a program to check the voting age a person.
