# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a 
# random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. 
# Download this file and save it in the same directory as your 
# Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the 
# dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. 
# Each line in the file contains a single word.

# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.


import random

with open("Day12\\dictionary.txt", 'r') as dictionary:
    line = list(dictionary)
    print(random.choice(line).strip())
