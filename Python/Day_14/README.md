# Python Challenge Day 15

Python supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on files. 

Write a python program to open a file in write mode and the stream is positioned at the end of the file. Also open the same file in read mode and the stream must be positioned at the beginning of the file.
