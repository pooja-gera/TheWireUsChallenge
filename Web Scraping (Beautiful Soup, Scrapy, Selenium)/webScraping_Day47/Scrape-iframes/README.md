# Challenge - Scrape from iframes.
Welcome to today's challenge!!üëã

In today's challenge we'll be using **Selenium** to extract some tables from a <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/index.html">website</a> having iframes. <br>
You might be wondering what are are iframes ü§î and why do we care to use Selenium on this website ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, why not only Beautiful soup will do our work. <br>
The **problem** is with iframes(learn about them in the resources file) which do not let us to access their contents (html) by simply using bs4 because these iframes have all together different HTML from the page source , see them as different websites present in one. That is why we are using **Selenium** for this task.

In this challenge you have to follow these steps using Selenium.
<p>You'll need to make a GET request at the <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/index.html">url</a> using selenium .<br>

<li>2 - There is an iframe having package name on the left side. Switch to this frame (<i>learn more about handling iframes using Selenium</i>)
