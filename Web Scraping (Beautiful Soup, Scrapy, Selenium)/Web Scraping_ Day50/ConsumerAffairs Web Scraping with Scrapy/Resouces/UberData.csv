"I had seven fraudulent Uber transactions over three days in mid-October on my credit card. For nearly a week, I tried unsuccessfully to get Uber customer service to help. Uber was totally uncooperative. They refused to engage in the fraudulent charges someone in their system imposed on me. I had to cancel my credit card, get a new credit card and leave my credit card company to battle awful Uber. Uber buyer beware. I know I will never use their services again.","Oct. 21, 2019",1.0
"Our driver never showed up and Uber cancelled our ride, not us. They charged us a cancellation fee for them cancelling. When I disputed it they would only credit it on future ride instead of refund back to our credit card. Why am I only getting a credit on account instead of a full refund to my credit card used?? This is not right what you have done when it was a Uber error.","Oct. 21, 2019",1.0
"When the service worked, it was good, and tech support responds quickly most of the time. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the problems I encountered. The app rejected my credit card and offered no explanation as to why. For some reason it accepted my PayPal even though it uses the very card the app had just rejected. It took days of back and forth with tech support to find out that my card ""isn't compatible with their system"", but they refused to be more specific than that and no matter how many times I asked what the exact problem was (ie my bank, the type of card, etc) all they did was rephrase the same answer over and over again with canned responses; repeatedly telling me to check w/ my bank, even after I told them I already had done so.","Oct. 20, 2019",1.0
"Being a responsible driver, I made the decision to use Uber after a few drinks at a local cantina. My friends and I live within a couple miles of each other, so we shared the Uber. I was the second person to be dropped off and my sole set of keys (i.e. car, house, storage, work) fell out of my pocket. I realized I had left them in the backseat almost immediately, but had no way to contact the driver bc, unfortunately, my friend was the one who ordered the ride. My friend contacted him the next day (that was a feat within itself bc Uber drivers are extremely protected), but did not receive a response.","Oct. 18, 2019",1.0
"They didn’t have cars available at Bush International Airport on October 15, 2019 at 9:30 pm. Had to take a taxi. This is the second time I have experienced this, and will be my last as I will use Lyft or a taxi in the future.","Oct. 18, 2019",1.0
"I have been punished for circumstances beyond my control. I have asked repeatedly for someone to tell me what I have done wrong or could have done differently and no one will talk to me about it. You see, I am a driver for Ubereats, and I loved it until Friday night when I had several orders not completed due to circumstances outside of my control. 2 orders could not be delivered because the restaurant wasn't serving the items at that time.

Upfront pricing not true pricing. Uber pads the bill so much. I've had Uber drivers charge for wait time when they are parked down from my house and I am out on my front porch waiting and watching them. Booking fee $3.05 come on! Toll and surcharges plus time and distance charges. Now they are dropping me off a few blocks from my destination saying they got to take another call. Uber drivers that I have used have showed up at my house wanting a hookup. One driver started groping me on my front porch. Uber customer service is a brick wall. Credited me $3.00 on a ride on Uber Cash. No matter what they do or charge they have an excuse and they are right. When I reported the sexual harassment of the two drivers they suspended my account. They cost more than a taxi and a taxi never has told me to get out and walk the rest of the way. ,"Oct. 14, 2019",1.0
"Drive with Uber you need to get better. I currently drive for Uber but am concerned with some drivers taking advantage of people with disabilities. I had picked up a Uber customer who had a 3 star rating, which to me I thought there was something wrong but still decided to accept the ride. When I picked up the gentleman I realized he was blind. As he got in my car we had a conversation and he told me that I was the quickest pick up he has ever gotten and asked me why. He told me he usually has to keep requesting Ubers over and over. I know why. It’s because the drivers are declining a 3 star rider. I told him it was because I don’t pass up any opportunities to pick people up to get them to their destination. He was the most kindest man I have ever met and I realized that other drivers have given him low ratings just because he had a disability.","Oct. 13, 2019",1.0

"Cherry picker???? Asks you where exactly you are going after he picks the order, asks if the lady is going alone, calculates if it is good money and company, then cancels the trip if it is not.

"So I took an Uber to the hospital for a medical procedure at 11:30 in the morning. Then that night at 11:30 at night a random man calls me to tell me he’s here to pick me up for my Uber. I said, ""No, I do not have an Uber now. I am asleep after having surgery."" The next day I see I am charged for that decline of service. I contacted Uber - they tell me they will take the charge off but it is not been taken off so far and I also have been charged twice for the original trip!

Last week I have a rider vomited and peed inside my vehicle and they refused to send me a cleaning fee. I talked to 5 different people in their driver's support team, but it seems they are ignorant and it seems Uber trained them to always provide the same answer.

"I have been using Uber as a rider from 2016 with a good passenger rating. Never had issues with any driver and my experience was in general good. A month ago Uber disabled my account. I reached customer support and after a few email exchanges, customer support sent me a rude (and offensive) email that I have violated the terms and conditions. I can safely say that this is truth challenged. I have no duplicate accounts, I am quiet as a rider and cooperative and never caused any issues. I asked customer support if there is a mistake and if they can lift the suspension but they ignored my request. This is no way to treat a client. Uber deals with problems because it cannot handle the vast clientele it has currently and makes mistakes, but this is no way to treat someone like this. I believe that TLC should investigate further how Uber is operating in terms of customer support, as well as monitor it much closer.","July 8, 2019",1.0

"I took Uber from IGT 1 to Sector 25 Noida and it shows rent of 820 approx. on Uber Premier, which looks good but when I reached my location without any stoppage driver asked me to pay 1210 rupees which is totally disappointing for me as prepaid taxi outside airport is even charging 950 rupees. But when I cross checked with my trip charges then I was shocked to see billing of 835 is showing on my app. I asked the driver to talk to Uber and check the same but he refused and asked to pay his charge as per his Uber application and write mail to Uber for the claim. I do took pictures of driver's mobile application screen and there is no transaction or reference number to track.

I was in Montreal last week as it was raining. Wanted a quick ride to my destination so booked an Uber. The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Uber doesn't tell you the amount right away.

"I ordered an Uber at the airport for me my boyfriend and his parents so 4 people and a couple luggages.

I was really upset and cancelled as per the driver's instruction and was charged a 5$ cancellation fee. I’ve been talking back and forth with Uber customer service for 4 days now and they refuse to credit me the fee even though they admit I’m right and apologized for the bad experience. Their reasoning is that too many fare adjustments were made on my account (which were warranted 'cause I was indeed overcharged on a few trips).

I had to go inside the doctor's office, where I had just left, to get a stool so I could climb into the truck. The Uber driver refused to cancel as he would be penalized, and I refused to cancel for the same reason. To end the stalemate, I was lucky the doctor's office had a stool. Uber is great for when you need a ride and are unable to drive for medical or other reasons. However, Uber does not seem to have any consensus control over the cars people are driving. Out of all the rides I needed, 50% were great and 50% were awful. I am thankful I am able to drive again.","March 15, 2019",3.0

I took Uber for the first time last month. My wife and I were at the Tokyo Airport and had many bags. We would have had to wait a few hours for a base bus on standby.

"My husband and I use UBER or Lyft frequently when we go out because we don't want to drink and drive, even a little. We moved a little over a year ago so now our average ride is about 25 minutes since we aren't as close to where we go with our friends. Without a doubt, at least the driver going there or coming home makes a complaint about the drive because they would like to stay in the busy area and just do a lot of short drives. It makes for a very uncomfortable ride. I even had one complain the whole time and then make sure I knew there was now an option for tipping. I tip almost all of the time but when I am made to feel uncomfortable because the driver has to do their job and drive me home, just farther than they would like, why would I tip that driver?! We all have things about our jobs we don't like but your main job is to drive.","March 20, 2019",2.0
Uber is convenient and fast. Cheaper than yellow cab. The platform has changed though with the nearby location pickup which is confusing at times because the location might be a couple of blocks from where you requested and the drop off time is near where you want to go even though after drop off the car drives past the location of drop off. Overall the rideshare company is great.,"March 20, 2019",4.0

I noticed this instantly and cancelled my order. Uber charged me for the order stating that I cancelled after the restaurant accepted the order!! I said, ""They do that instantly, so when do I have time to cancel my order without penalty of paying for an entire meal that I didn’t receive?"" ","March 7, 2019",1.0
Uber has been ripping its drivers off and need a class action lawsuit against them for doing so on several occasions. I've reached out to them about trips I completed with them and never got paid for. I completed a delivery and was not paid for doing so on several occasions and the customer service sucks and require us to email them to get help. They ask you to wait 24/48 hours to be paid but they never pay you.,"March 7, 2019",1.0

Using this is convenient. I like the fact that sometimes when I don't want to drive I can use Uber to get where I need to go.

"Uber has the worst customer service ever! If you lose an item in one of their vehicles - such as your phone, they require you to LOG IN ON THE APP ON YOUR PHONE to report it - doesn't make ANY SENSE. If you lost your phone you can't use the app! I tried to log in online to report lost phone in the vehicle and their support says they need me to VERIFY MY NUMBER ON MY PHONE - which is impossible if it is the item lost in the car! It is the #1 most common lost item in Uber, yet they still haven't figured out a way to easily report or get a hold of your driver after you have exited car. I tried to contact their customer service phone number and they hung up on me. Called again and had to say I was in an accident to get anyone on the phone. Never recovered phone.

More people are going to go back to trains and buses in order to save money to get to and from work.

What am I getting from your safety initiatives? Just another trick to charge customers more. Would love to see the list of Uber initiates they currently do for passengers. Also, there is no transparency about the fee. It should be added to the estimated cost of a trip before a customer orders rather than in a sneaky way of adding after the fact.

"Uber steals what little drivers make and puts the money in their fat pockets. Doesn’t even come close to making minimum wage. Uber is too busy stealing from drivers while reducing their pairing. They control your earnings and steal 40% waste of time, money and gas. You’ll drive around more looking for trips than you would actually driving passenger. If you complain Uber retaliates. Uber has made numerous changes to drivers earnings while they collect all the profit including the pools that should count multiple passengers towards your quest. Instead only counts as one trip. You make less than minimum wage and isn’t even worth carpooling to work. Drivers are going on strike for a reason because Uber steals from them. Waiting two hours for a passenger nothing.

Oh you say it makes no damn sense, yeah you're right. Smfh. Uber takes no time whatsoever to do any sort of investigation not even an email to find out anything at all from the driver. They just send an email saying that they took your money and you wasted your time. This is not the only nonsense that I have had to deal with.

Firstly Uber uses an outsourced call center to receive and take calls for their company. The employee I spoke to was a supervisor by the name of JOHN who was in the Philippines.

The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that’s did not feel or look safe.

I've made the same journey multiple times. On one occasion I trusted Uber to reflect my pick up location rather than my position when I requested the ride.

Here's all my journeys below showing an obvious trend with - hiccup on this mentioned ride. The help desk keeps blaming price rises but that's a 350% price rise!!! 6th March at 1803 cost $11.77. 4th March at 1808 cost $48.22 but they gave me $10 back. 4th March at 1041 cost $11.19. 28th February at 1807 cost $11.44. 26th February at 1811 cost $11.64. 19th February at 1809 cost $11.95. 13th February at 1805 cost $11.69. 12th February at 1803 cost $11.63.,"March 5, 2019",1.0

"Been driving for Uber about a year now and am very unhappy with the way they conduct business. There are so many issues that I could write all day about, but needless to say their app is flawed and their customer service is a joke. They are not consistent on how much they pay and since I have so many passengers throughout the day it's near impossible to keep track of the details of every fare. But after 2000+ passengers you start to get a sense of basically how much you'll get paid for rides taking a certain amount of time going a certain distance. Uber compensates me different amounts periodically, sometimes it will be a fair amount while other times I feel very shorted, of course I've never felt overpaid... Imagine that.","March 5, 2019",1.0

I got $10.00 towards the next ride. This is a nightmare and feels like a scam. I need a full refund to my card and not a discount for the next ride.

"I have had a few great experiences and a couple of bad experiences. Worst experience was being picked up in an emergency situation when I needed to get to the hospital to visit someone. I was in a hurry and we were already on the highway when I realized the driver reeked of alcohol and was completely intoxicated, weaving in and out of lanes and could not keep the car between the lanes.

"I’ve never used Lyft before, and the only cab company is highly ineffective. Uber, oddly enough, has attracted highly qualified, a very polite, drivers who drive Uber to earn extra money. I enjoy that scheduling a ride is simple through a smartphone application. Once Uber detects the local drivers, via GPS, it directs the closest driver who’s available and provides an estimated time to wait, and an estimated time a arrival to your destination. Uber also allows users to estimate the cost of rides in advance. Also, Uber allows the rider to tip directly from the application and also rate the driver. I’ve never had an issue with any Uber driver I’ve used. It’s more uncommon for me now, but every so often I do use Uber.","March 18, 2019",5.0
"I've never had a negative experience with Uber. It was the one I downloaded first while in college and the one I've continue to use these past 3 or so years. Some experiences have been better than others but in my opinion the drivers probably have had a worse experience. The rides I've enjoyed the most were the ones when myself and the driver have respected each other's privacy, acted courteously and professional. I have witnessed people trash and throw up all over a driver's car, and that's not alright. I think the thing that has begun to creep into the way I view Uber is all of its negative publicity. Why would I support an enterprise that I don't agree with? It's not like I am dependent on Uber. I can use other ridesharing apps, I can use a traditional taxi, I can even use public transportation. Despite all of this, I still use Uber but that might not always be the case.","March 16, 2019",5.0

So after telling her twice I grabbed her jacket sleeve between thumb and forefinger and told her ""firm Voice"", ""You need to move to the center so my son can get in.""

"Everytime Uber makes an update it inconveniences its riders more and more. The update to the GPS has caused so much confusion for me and my drivers. Most of the time the address takes me to the back of the building I ask to go. Also this new Uber pool walking thing in the middle of winter is a horrible idea. The whole point of us using Uber instead of riding buses is so that we can get dropped off and picked up at our door not walk two blocks in the cold. And you shouldn't have to pay extra just to avoid walking, I've had drivers cancel either way so we were better off without that update. Uber used to seem to care more about its customers, I wish it would go back to being that way. I've been riding Ubers since the beginning.","Jan. 16, 2019",2.0
"I have been a driver with Uber for the last two-and-a-half years. I have been through thick and thin with him and their customers doing bad things to me as a driver. I stop driving for them for a while and hope that things would change. They have upgraded the app so I tried to start driving again. They wanted a new picture of my license. I've uploaded it over 10 times, sent to them multiple pictures and they keep on saying poor image and then they won't approve it. And when I call him they have excuses on all its poor image. Part of it's always the same thing. They will never let you talk to a supervisor. Never let you talk to a manager. They never let you talk to anybody in charge. There's always people laughing in the background. They don't have no respect for their drivers and whoever is going to drive for them. They just need to stop because Uber won't back you up.","Jan. 15, 2019",1.0

That did not work and the support representative in the 2nd call told me I was in good standing but should try an alternate card. This did not work either in the representative. In the 3rd call told me to email support to get a higher level support person. Uber responded to my email by telling me that my account was suspended due to ""suspect appeasement"".

"I have used Uber to get to and from places and generally have never had any issues.

For example, the general price to and from my house to downtown is $18 but they increased the price to $30 on New Year's of 2017-2018. That was annoying because they knew that many people would be vulnerable at 2-3 am and willing to pay that amount to get home. It was frustrating but doable, especially if you were lucky enough to find a buddy to split it with. However, this New Year's (2018-2019) Uber began adding surge charges in the beginning of events, thus I was charged about $30 to get to the event and then they had the audacity to increase the surge charge to $98 for the return trip! $98!

"Venmo sent me an email with a code for $10 off an Uber ride as a celebration for being able to use them as a payment method. I applied the code to my account, took a ride, the code didn't apply. I asked Uber support why and they said I had to make sure payment was on Venmo. Alright. I took another ride and made sure Venmo was my payment, still nothing. Contacted Uber support over 7 times and got answers ranging from, ""we don't know what ride you're talkkng about"", to ""select your payment method to apply credit"" to ""This code expired"", ""We're unable to refund or credit this ride"". Basically, they refuse the email fine print from Venmo and don't care that there was a promo code that was supposed to work on their platform. Very poor service.","Oct. 2, 2018",1.0
I was quoted $6.25 for my ride and charged that. Hours after my drop off I received multiple notifications of a charge of $16.14 and $9.87 being charged to my card for my one ride. Yes 3 separate charges for one Uber express pool ride. I immediately filed a complaint which really only wasted my time and pissed me off even more. I was bounced from rep to rep and had to restate the same information over and over and OVER again. The last rep made it seem like she had resolved the issue until today when I saw a pending charge of $16.14 on my company card which is linked to my Uber account for business travel. ,"Oct. 2, 2018",1.0

"I have never had an issue with Uber in the last two years of using their service until two days ago, when I scheduled a ride the night before. Upon entering the details, a window popped up on the app indicating a Pick Up guarantee. If the driver did not show up within the window of time allotted, the passenger would be credited $10 for a future ride so long as it met the eligibility criteria. My driver exceeded the window of time and arrived later. As a result, I was late to arrive for my appointment. I wrote to customer service and requested the credit. The rep stated they would credit $5 instead. When I quoted their policy verbatim, the second rep stated they would not be paying any additional credit. 24 hours later, they still haven’t even credited the $5.

My periodic follow-ups were useful only to be told that a specialized team was looking into it. I never asked for troubleshooting details but only for the charge to be switched between the cards registered in the account.

LESSON LEARNED: When getting into the car, BE SURE TO CONFIRM your desired destination by exact street address with the driver. Uber's drivers simply follow the GPS in the app and won't ask to confirm. Uber's drivers are stupid automatons. No wonder Uber is on forefront of developing driverless technology... they are practically there already. The Uber app will offer several alternate destinations as you type in the destination address. If you, by chance, tap the wrong one - and don't notice - you'll wind up on wrong side of town.

The Uber app has the help option but only accommodates a number of preset problem configurations and absolutely nothing outside of it. I had an issue where I was grossly overcharged for a ride.

There is no way to get help or even talk to someone from the company and the app was difficult to navigate.

There wasn’t even a way to ask about it and the drivers got none of the extra money!! Lastly, I kept getting strange texts for Uber codes after I began the process of trying to be a driver.

"The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89. There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience.","July 20, 2018",1.0
I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Uber at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company.,"July 20, 2018",1.0

The drivers bare all the cost, they pay for the car, the maintenance, the gas, their time and they are not a employee with benefits.

"I love Uber. However, its customer service can do better. Read my Story. I have a fear of driving. As a result, for the last four years, I have used Uber almost every day to go everywhere; work, events, etc. I even use uber when I travel abroad. As an uber-veteran, I have experienced the good, the bad and the ugly. Yesterday, I forgot my phone in an uber vehicle. When I realized this, I used my room mate's phone to try to log into my account and contact the driver. However, I had forgotten my password. I decided to request a new one. That is where the trouble started. To help you retrieve your password, Uber has a two-step verification; they send you a four-digit code to your phone. This, of course, is for our safety. The problem is ""how do you get the code if you don't have your phone?"" The answer is easy. ""Customer service."" Right? Only mine was not so easy. ","June 30, 2018",1.0

Uber is fine unless you're trying to cancel a trip. I accidentally booked a trip. I contacted the driver and immediately within 30 seconds and he did not cancel it. I responded again 5 minutes later. The driver did not cancel. He finally told me to cancel after he arrived at my destination. The issue I have is that there's no cancellation button. I was scrolling through every area of the Uber app trying to figure out how to cancel this ride even after I contacted the driver and I could not locate anything. Upon intensive internet search trying to find an 800 number to call Uber directly and being unsuccessful I finally did an online search and was told thru a wiki article how to cancel a trip... to click on a tiny picture of the driver to access the cancel button. This is deceptive practice. I was charged $13.37 because of the driver's time because he did not cancel the ride and I had no idea or information on how to cancel it myself. ,"Aug. 28, 2018",2.0

A few seconds later, I received a notification that I had been charged $79.72! Uber informed me that there was a ""surge charge"" (which I had never heard of) and that it is applicable, essentially when there are very few drivers available, relative to the number of riders needing rides. Supposedly, the rider is notified of the surge charge before accepting or rejecting the ride, but I wasn't. I was simply told ""$21.**"", then charged $79.72.

I try a second time to locate a driver on Uber but none available and a driver also not available on Lyft. I end up with a taxi and a hefty fare charge. Uber touts that they offer a guarantee that your driver will be there during your pick-up time or they will give you a $10 credit.

The map to walk to the pickup point was COVERED IN UBER NOTICES plus what little of the map I could see lacked any street names next to me, nor did uber provide directions on where to walk, nor were the dots accurate (perhaps it wanted me to use the backdoor because those dots sure didn't make sense walking out the front door) and Uber did NOT provide an exact physical address for me to google. Worst, is uber provides NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM and now uber charges me a $5 cancellation fee for a $2.78 ride? Seriously - this IS fraudulent!

I have contacted Uber and they claim that the charge is justified because it happened during alleged peak hours and after back and forth correspondence offered to credit me back 25% of that charge, which is still way too high. Let us run the numbers. Effectively, what Uber is trying to say by defending this charge of $43.70 for 20 minute 8.1 miles long ride is that your driver is making $131.10/hour that would translate into $272,480 annual salary!!!

"I usually purchase a Uber Gift Card to run weekly errands as Uber. The reason why I use that method was because every time I used my bank card Uber puts a ridiculous hold on my card causing my bank account to be overdrawn. To combat that issue I started purchasing the Uber Gift Card. This past weekend, I was preparing to go grocery shopping and tried requesting for an Uber using my gift card credit. This was a short trip literally 4 blocks at that. I received a message saying try a new payment method, so I said I will add another Uber gift card. That didn't work, so I called a local cab to pick up me up and take me to the store. I thought it may have been an issue with the application, so I went on shopping.

At least on the Uber side of things. We live in Tucson, Arizona, and on the Uber site it states that our city has no fee associated with vehicle inspection. However, after signing up and getting all her ducks in a row she came to find that her account had a negative -$20 balance.

When I got my emailed receipt, the ride was $10 more than it should have been!

"I am a driver on the Uber platform and have driven in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and now South Carolina. I recently had my account put on hold due to a ""report of possible impairment while driving"". This is maybe the 4th random reporting that is totally b.s. As a ** man I receive all types of race and gender related ignorance and biases and I am vulnerable at all times unless I protect myself while I am on the road. Uber allows passengers to make false reports that affect the driver, but has no way for the driver to protect themselves from the false attacks. After research it's a drastically common issue on the Uber platform. I suggest anyone looking to drive for Uber understand that while you are an independent contractor for Uber, you will still suffer the consequences of the reality that Uber is ran like a private correctional facility. DRIVE AT YOUR OWN HIGH RISK.","April 27, 2018",1.0
Needed a ride home after work. Tried to use Uber. Big mistake. It was raining outside when I was leaving work. The app showed the driver was a few minutes out. The app showed them drive past where I was. Added time to their arrival. Saw the app show the vehicle driving past where I was adding more time. The app changed again adding again the time of arriving. I tried to call the driver to no avail. I cancelled costing me $5.00. Unreliable as far as I am concerned. Had to call a cab.

On attempt to confirm ride home I had no credits remaining, even after the first ride receipt only showed $6. This left me stranded and having to walk 4 miles home because I had no more payment options. Contacted Uber via email when made it home. They gave me some dumb excuse about an authorization hold on an additional $6 to ensure there was enough on payment method to cover trip.

Which brings me to my next issue with Uber — there have been times we’ve ordered a car, got downstairs in the time it would take, and the car is gone! We get charged anyway. Unfair and ridiculous.

My son ordered Uber, and the time he received his message, he went out but the driver had left by then... and ignored his calls, leaving him in a road that barely has any car passing from there. Then he finally replied and told him that he waited for so long... Seriously!! Isn’t there a charge for this time? The surprise is, when I called him to ask him to go back, he refused, and the second surprise is that my son had to pay for the car that was cancelled by Uber not by him...

Gave wrong rating for the driver by mistake and asked customer care for editing the review. Answer was big NO to it. Sometimes people make mistakes and should be given a chance to correct it.

Each time they replied with a scripted email that stated the last promo code added is the first to be applied and they cannot switch the order they are applied. First, their statement was incorrect because the app did not work as they explained and when I stated this they sent the same scripted response to me.

Which is great, when dealing with the harsh winter. The issue is the service coming from the Uber drivers and Uber's customer service. Most recently I took a Uber ride to Far Rockaway, NY to Queens, NY which was a $50 dollar Uber pool. The car was very cold and in the beginning the Uber driver was very quiet. Once we got closer the destination the Uber driver began to get confused on what route to take. As I asked to make a right at the next light he turned around while driving and began to yell at me. We were on a parkway in Far Rockaway with cars driving all around us. He began to shout and hits brake twice jerking me from out of the seat.

When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had ""Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No"" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak.

I will no longer ride with Uber and leave a driver who may be unhappy in his or her job or having a bad day or expecting a cash tip to rate me as a client and passenger. I treat all people with kindness and respect and my driver ratings have always been very good to excellent. You have lost a loyal customer.","Oct. 27, 2017",2.0

Me, my husband, and six year old daughter requested an Uber to take us back to the Sanford International Airport Wednesday, October 25th from Disney's Art of Animation Resort.

"We used Uber about 10 times over a week on an Orlando vacation instead of renting a car and had very good results except for the last trip from our hotel to the airport. The initial estimated cost was $21.86 and it ended up taking 20 minutes or so. At the airport we were shocked that we had paid $65.91 and the receipt showed a distance of 74 miles, a trip time of 53 minutes and the map of the route was different from the one that we had taken! We contacted Uber and they promptly refunded the extra cost. Very bizarre - I hope this is an isolated incident and that Uber investigates.

You cannot speak to anyone and the support ""messages"" or solutions are all canned or templates. There is no humanity for ""outside the box"" incidents. I recently had an incident on the freeway while I had a rider in the car. A motorcycle was ""lane splitting"" (in California) and deliberately punched my drivers' side mirror.

Then my host Jennifer booked for me, meanwhile the surcharge was 2.4. I finally arrived with much delay at the railway station. The driver just cancelled since he expected more profitable trips to perform during that time. This practice was confirmed by another Uber driver in Boston when I openly talked with him.

Finally Uber paid me back only the 5 USD cancellation fee, they did not refund me the approx 15 USD loss being the difference between factor 1.4 and 2.4.","Oct. 18, 2017",1.0

This the ** Uber driver, still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away. Uber needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry, if customers want ** service they would take a cab.

I figured since Uber pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UberX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car.

I have emailed Uber numerous times about this issue and have had no luck getting anything but an automated response saying that the issue has been resolved and that I should order an Uber XL for larger groups (which is what I did, but did not get an Uber XL). I have requested the $20 refund for the price difference with no success. It is not necessarily about the $20 - it is the principle.

I started using UBER while on vacation in Arizona a couple years ago. Took it to and from the airport. I was shocked on how easy it was! I LOVE that there is no money that exchanges hands at all. I was a little leery about providing my credit card info when I signed up but I've never had a problem. I've used UBER so many times since then in different places... Like Chicago! It's just so much cheaper than a cab plus the drivers are usually very friendly and like to tell you about different places to visit (if you're a tourist). Recently I was on a trip to San Francisco and used UBER the whole time. Something new I learned about while there was UBER POOL. The driver picks up a number of people at different stops and drops everyone off at their pre-determined destination and it was only $4.99 per trip because you are sharing a ride with others.

Customer Service has not been helpful and have yet to provide me with any documentation to support the adjusted fare.

I recently took an Uber and was checking my trips the next day and see that I was being charged a cleaning fee of $150. My driver's name was Michael and picked me up in Delray Beach Florida and dropped me off in Boca Raton Florida. The ride cost $18.42. When I asked Uber through the Uber help I was advised I was being charged a cleaning fee. I then received pictures of vomit that was on the seat and the floor. This was something that I absolutely did not do. I have asked that the community manager in my area call me and I have not received any response. These pictures that were submitted were not from me. I feel violated and feel nothing I can do but dispute these charges with my bank.,"Aug. 17, 2017",1.0

I responded providing screenshots, and after 3 hours of waiting and hearing nothing, I was told they wouldn't be issuing a refund because based on the trip details, it ""looks like the trip took place""...

In fact there is no customer service per se but a critical safety response line which wasn't much of the help in our problem. What happened is that my husband left in Uber his wallet with all his documents, id cards, credit cards, pictures etc. He really got stressed out about it a lot, we contacted Uber through an app right away as we were not able to reach the driver. You must know that you really can't reach the driver even though the Uber app would transfer your call to him.

Once at the gate, I thought I would go back into the app and learn about it, and perhaps discover where to enter promo codes. That's when I saw that a second charge of $97.94 had been applied. To make a long story short, and after a number of back and forth emails with UBER, it seems that my driver Yuniel, who could not speak a word of English, claimed that my dog (which I do not have) had urinated all over his seats.

My score has always been 5 stars until then, but Uber is allowing drivers to leave a negative rating for riders that have reported them or left a negative feedback due to unprofessional, rude, dangerous behavior. My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way.

"First, my complaint is Uber REFUSES to call anyone so you can have a conversation about your dissatisfaction. Second my complaint is that they are running a bait and switch that is unethical. My TRIP: THE ISSUE is that their app told me I could USE UberX for a trip from the Indianapolis airport to my house in Cincinnati and the fee would be $115. I checked it 3 different time during the week to confirm the rate wasn't a error. When I got to the Indy airport from FL I checked it again and the app said my cost would be $115. WHEN the driver showed up tells me that I can't use UberX but had to select UberXL because of the distance of the trip.","May 26, 2017",1.0
My name is Scott and my husband was working for Uber. He had a ride with 3 people in it. When they got in they had a metal smoking pipe that they put out on the hood liner of my car. The pipe was left in the car and a burn hole in my car. He sent pictures to Uber and they said that they needed a quote. So the first quote we got was almost $2000 from Chrysler since that's my car. We only received the quote over the phone. It was too far away to drive so we called Chrysler near us. They referred us to a person that gave us a quote of about $300. He sent the quote to Uber and they got back to him today.,"May 26, 2017",1.0

"I noticed that the reviews for Uber were low on this site so I felt compelled to share my positive experiences with readers. My husband has been using Uber for quite some time because he does a lot of traveling with his occupation. We used Uber together on our trip to San Juan Puerto Rico recently and every ride was 5 star and top notch. The drivers were friendly and professional. All of the vehicles we rode in smelled fresh and clean. We actually had a taxi driver harass one of our drivers and although we had our Uber driver pick us up at the business next door to our hotel, the taxi driver could tell it was Uber because my husband had his phone in his hand & we waved to the Uber driver. I can honestly say that due to the taxi driver scaring me by bullying our driver, I will NEVER take a taxi again as long as I live. Last I checked, we live in a capitalist society and competition is good for us. Taxis should not have a monopoly! I highly recommend Uber.","May 20, 2017",5.0

This all started last Friday 5/5, I requested Uber at 6:28, my Uber took a few min. but Pineda came at a reasonable time. My stop is 5-6 min. from my house but the stupid Uber app told the driver to go in the opposite direction to get the other rider 15 min away and therefore made me miss my 7 am bus. So I then had to take another Uber because the next bus was 7:35 and that would have made me even later for work. Not only that but I have taken this ride several times and it cost $6, why was I charged $9.30. The receipt even says $6.26. So now I have to request another Uber to get me to the train.

But Uber won't let you enjoy this convenience as much especially recently when they changed some of their policies. Here is an example, it is late at night, you just had fun in your friend's house and it is time to request Uber to take you home. You request Uber. Wait outside for the driver.

"I have been using Uber for many years (especially as a consultant, I used them weekly for my work travel to/from airports) but was disgusted with the way the company treated me as a customer. On 4/13, I requested a pickup from LGA, Terminal C, Pickup area 1. I attempted to call the driver 5 times to let him know my exact location at Terminal C pickup area but got his voicemail each time. I waited over 15 mins just to see him drive past the requested pickup area and continue to drive through all of Terminal C (as I was trying to chase him down) without slowing down or attempting to pull into any of the subsequent pickup areas to look for me.

"Be alert for selecting UberPool for a reduced fare but being charged UberX or Economy at double the fare. When attempting to resolve, the company will state things such as 'we've adjusted a fare in the past for you' coupled with 'your fare is correct,' finally with a conclusion of 'your driver selected the trip in good faith.' I have been an Uber passenger on many occasions and never had a fare adjusted. My fare was absolutely incorrect and my driver selecting my trip is great, however, I wish to not pay a much higher fare for a type of ride I did not select.

"Concept of Uber is great. Try finding customer service is the pits. Once you contact them via messaging you will find that if you have an ongoing conversation, replies their system is set up to tag next available service rep. Meaning every time you send in your reply, a new service rep has to review all the conversations to get the rest of the customer’s problem. Extremely time consuming on both parts. My wife is presently texting them as I write. I'm not a patient man and have spent two three days going back and forth on a relatively simple question.

When I questioned the first driver about the route we were taking he advised he missed his exit causing him to take the next exit which was completely out of the way. The second driver took the direct route with no problem. When I questioned Uber customer service they explained how algorithms work and found no fault with the fare. I received my receipt and noticed the total should have been 12.84. They did refund the $3 difference but refused to acknowledge the difference in price between the first and second driver even though it was entirely driver error.

I have been taking Uber quite faithfully twice a day for several months now and my pick up and drop off locations have never changed however Uber consistently changes the one address every time. I was OK with that since I was still getting where I needed to be until they started changing the quoted fees as well. When I called them out on it they would say that they had checked and that the information they had was correct. I have emailed them copies of the address plaque on the building where they are picking me up and they are still insisting that I am being picked up at a different address and that it is a longer ride and therefore a higher fare.

So after I realized he was not coming like I found another Uber driver that could take me to my dr. appointment. Well unfortunately by the time we got there I was already past my appointment time seven minutes or so so they would not honor my appointment.

"I leased a car thru Uber leasing program in Tampa Honda. I was not given a choice of car and wound up with a 2015 Corolla with stains and burn holes on the seats.

They wouldn't issue a new temp tag, told me they mailed it out on 3 different dates and NY temporary tag expired.

Then the Uber application routes you to the wrong location and doesn't understand what direction your car is actually going I used both Google maps and Waze applications and had the same issue. The Uber application doesn't interface with either well and has you going in circles quite often. Uber will waste your time and money when you make some. Uber gets a big portion of it in fees. They should have done a better job of development. My car GPS runs circles around Uber's application and has no problems getting me to specific addresses. So what's wrong with Uber's application?,"Jan. 29, 2017",1.0

I have been driving with Uber for over three months. I have great reviews from passengers who I have dropped off at many locations all around Orlando. I strongly recommend that no one drives with Uber. They are complete rip off. You will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you don't even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if there's a rude passenger which Uber does not confirm who the passenger is. They will cause damage to your car and once he reported to Uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and I did no longer responsible. Any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay $1000 or more to fix your own car. They don't want to take responsibility for anything and when you sign up for Uber it clearly states that they are responsible for damages caused by passengers.,"Jan. 12, 2017",1.0

Next day I checked my phone, never got any type of email receipt (usually I get them immediately after I get dropped off) so I begin to think they didn't charge me. ","Feb. 8, 2016",1.0

"I downloaded the app and tried out a promotion to give me $22 dollars off our first ride, since it was our first time in Miami, we decided to use it. After waiting almost 45 minutes the driver said she picked us up and dropped us off in 5 seconds. Not only did she waste my time but my promo code. My fiance and I decided to give them a try again, this time he said he wanted to do everything. So he created an account and used the same promo code. The app stated it took it, after the ride was over, it sent us a bill and said if there is a problem contact customer service. It was only $14, but when we contacted customer service, Rachelle basically said we didn't put in a promo code so she refused to help us. Not only are the drivers terrible but the customer service is even worse. STAY AWAY from Uber. I tried Lyft after a friend recommended it, and honestly it's 1000x better!

I get an unknown call from someone with an middle eastern accent named Mike ** claiming my email was hacked and wanted me to get on a laptop or desktop to ""solve"" the issue by getting IP addresses off my account.

We contacted Uber (which wasn't easy, there's hardly any working phone numbers) asking for them to message the other riders and find out if they accidentally took the bag. Even armed with a police report, Uber has done nothing to help resolve the matter. Clearly, riders should always remove their belongings and hopefully drivers will check the backseat to make sure it is empty. Sadly, this didn't happen and our son's personal belongings are in the hands of criminals with Uber's blessing.","Dec. 21, 2015",1.0

These were colleagues that were also going to the cruise port so I told them that I would take care of the fare. Once we got there, they gave the driver a very generous tip not realizing the tip was include, but the driver had no problem accepting it. I got my receipt as I always do and then ten minutes later, I got another receipt with an additional 14.00 charge, which they charged my credit card.

I got assaulted, got some weird smelly liquid sprayed inside my car with no idea of what it was, a bottle thrown at me, my car kicked by that same rider (luckily there wasn't any dents), and then when I call the safety line to report the incident, my account got terminated for having to physically remove that rider when she tries to jump back inside my car while I am not even in it.

A truly incredible business model though...for them to get rich, not you...ever. No one was ever able to explain to me if it actually made dollar sense to drive, so I took a one month part time challenge driving 70 hours total on some weekdays and some weekends. Don't believe the liars who say they make $1,500 a week or more.

But I have requested and wasn't happy with my wait time and cancelled within seconds and was charged. On 3 occasions this happened, fortunately they credit back my account.

I was connected to the same driver, but surely enough the app said I was on my way after a few moments. Again, I wanted to give my driver the benefit of the doubt and I chalked it up to the fact that I haven't updated Uber yet.

What's up with that?

Uber has no city or government limit on prices, meaning that they can pretty much gouge what they want, as opposed to taxis who have rates limited by law.

"March 2015 I took a trip to New York. A coworker suggested I try the Uber app. Trip one, the pick up at the airport, the driver was sitting in the wrong place and expected me to walk to him at the other end of the terminal.

It took him 25 minutes to find me, when the APP showed his car making circles around the blocks nearby. Trip 3 the driver did not know where to go to find Broadway and Lafayette. Uber drivers use their personal cars to pick up a few fares. They don't know the normal taxi protocols, and it cost be double or more for each local ride.

I really like the app and how you can see where the driver is so I know when to leave out my apartment and meet them. But prior to my order I added two credit cards to my Uber account. One is a bank debit card the other is a prepaid debit card, both with VISA logos. Uber defaulted to the bank card for payment. However, I wanted to use the prepaid debit card but for some reason it wouldn't switch. My bank card didn't have the funds for the trip but it allowed the pre-authorization.","Dec. 10, 2015",2.0

My experience is much better than many of the reviews. The drivers I have had are friendly and helpful. Several times there has been a problem with the software but fare adjustment was done right away. I sent emails to customer support about problems in the software that had the driver going around in circles trying to get the software to start -- Resulting in me being charged $9.00 too much. I emailed customer service and received an adjustment to my debit card within 2 hours. No car company can be on time all the time especially in traffic. I live outside the city and commute to high traffic areas. I find UBER to be MUCH more reliable than yellow cab.,"Nov. 28, 2015",5.0

I was charged for a defective new service and a defective app that fails to cancel their failed new services.

When I got the finally bill, they put $104 as meter price and added 20% tip ($21) for the driver who doesn't even speak English. And also charged me $2 as ""booking fee"" thus to make the total bill as $128 as the driver initially reported. I was shocked that this is the company advertising not to take tips and now they added 20% tip by myself and billed me. No matter how many emails I sent to their customer support, nobody responded.

(1) You cannot cancel an ordered drive when it becomes apparent that the driver of the car cannot seem to find where you are at despite phone calls and having past your drive area two to three times without having to pay for the cancellation because of the driver's outright ineptness.

There were no incidents in this car! No vomiting, nobody had any drinks or food. There were 3 adults, no children. This Uber driver is either lying or confusing us with someone else. It is wrong that Uber just automatically charges the customer without asking if it is correct and the driver should have to report it immediately or have the passenger acknowledge the incident.

Uber gets between 33% and 45% of the money, at the higher end on short trips, which are more common. And there is the waiting and drive time when you are off the clock! At least in my market (Twin Cities, MN) you are going to make about $10 to $13 an hour BEFORE EXPENSES. When you factor in gas, wear and tear on your car, tires, brakes, etc. you are likely making about $5 per hour!
