# Challenge - Scrape International Space Station's Location
If you ever wondered of finding the location of ISS hovering above our heads at an altitude of 248 miles, you are in the right place to achieve this. 
<p>P.S. idk why you would ever wanna find the location of ISS ðŸ˜› but for the sake of understanding APIs it's a fun and interesting exercise and it's space so it's quiet fascinating.</p>

You'll need to make a **GET** request at the api with - 
**url**="http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json" and parse the data into a python object for extracting the longitude and latitude of the station. After doing this just print and update both of these units every 5 seconds for a total of 30 seconds.
**Et Voila!** You get the 6 positions of ISS in a span of 30 seconds.
