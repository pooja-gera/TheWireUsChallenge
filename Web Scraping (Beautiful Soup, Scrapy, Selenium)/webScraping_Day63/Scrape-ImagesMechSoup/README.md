# Challenge - Scrape Images using Mechanical Soup

Beautiful soup and Selenium are cool libraries for interacting with websites. But, have you tried using **Mechanical Soup** ⁉️

### What is Mech. Soup Library ? 🤔
**Mechanical Soup** is a Python library for automating interaction with websites. This library automatically stores and sends cookies, follows redirects and can follow links and submit forms. MechanicalSoup provides a similar API, built on Python giants Requests (for HTTP sessions) and BeautifulSoup (for document navigation).

In essence, MechanicalSoup installs what’s known as a **headless browser**, which is a web browser with no graphical user interface. This browser is controlled programmatically via a Python program.

So, what's the advantage of using a headless browser?

### 1) Improves speed and performance 🚀
- Since this type of testing does not actually open a browser, the system saves the processing power that would otherwise be used in a real browser test. Consequently, the tests are executed faster.

### 2) Helps you multitask 👩🏻‍💻
- You can use your browser or your machine to do anything else while the tests run in the background. Save hours of time that is otherwise spent staring at the screen.

There are several other numerous advantages of using headless browser but it beyond the scope of this challenge.

## Your Task 🎮

- In this challenge you'll have to scrape images of different tesla car models like - tesla model x, model y, model 3, roadster and tesla cyber truck using Mechanical soup library. (Learn more about Mech. Soup in resources.txt file)

- Make a get request to the google chrome images <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=EN">search engine</a> using Mech. Soup and fill the search with the model of the car to get the images.
Do this for all the cars.

- Save these images of cars to directories named after their models for segregation.

## Come on get your hands dirty 👨🏻‍💻 You can do it 👍🏻
