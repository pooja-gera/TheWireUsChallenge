# Challenge - Scrape Images from Facebook using Facebook Graph API
In this simple challenge you will get a basic overview of why APIs are used and what we can achieve by using them.
You'll need to make a GET request at the url - 
url="http://graph.facebook.com/{x}/picture?type=large" where "x" is the number of profile-pic. Save the images numbering from 100 to 120 i.e a total of 20 profile photos in a folder.
<p>For example - A GET request made to the url http://graph.facebook.com/{4}/picture?type=large will output the following image.
<br>
<img width="100" src="./assets/profile4.jpg"> Say Hi to mark!!
