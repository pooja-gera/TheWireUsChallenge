Ordered the ginger noodle soup, for someone who charge's more when a soup is split it seemed like they just made one bowl and divided into two.. why charge more then? Had the chicken roulade, again one roll split into 4 pieces. Dan Dan noodles, palm sized serving. Lucky Chan is charging rates that yuatcha does, they don't have the quality, quantity or Michelin star for it. I would definitely go to yuatcha over here any day.,Kenny was extremely hospitable and ensured we had a good time. Top notch service! Great food and lovely drinks! Peach Bellini is amazing here. In the food section, cheesey basil dim sum is to die for! Love the place. Already visited twice within a week.,They need to either get the price lower or increase the food portion."

Broomie's Bakery made sure that we went out smiling. Initially, we went to buy a single cake only. However, the lip-smacking procedure & a few samples made us buy two infact. I never had this kinda experience ever IN Faridabad. I loved it, my friends loved it, that's what I wanted. Definitely coming back again & a must visit Bakery. Perhaps the best one around. ,Thank you Broomie's. Keep up the good work üòä ,Broomie's Bakery is the most finest Bakery I have come across. I ordered Chocolate Truffle Cake for my brother's birthday and it tasted amazing. We also ordered Alfredo Pasta from this bakery and it was unbelievably rich in flavours. Both the orders tasted great and were packed nicely.,The delivery was on time too. Looking forward to order again from this bakery!,Ordered pink sauce pasta from this place a while ago and I really liked it. It was awesome. Delivery was packed properly and rates were reasonable. Had a great time.,Superb!!,I tried Farm house pizza and Mix berry shake, both were excellent.,Really enjoyed!!,Highly recommended!!!"

Good quality and fresh food served. Great varieties of pizzas. I like the way they garnish their pizzas with all the toppings. Good quantity of toppings and cheese, pizzas bread is too soft, sauces are flavourful. Other than pizzas they also serve Garlic bread, chicken dishes and desserts. Collectively a good and pocket friendly place.,Mayo is fine, but not on pizza. This is the exact reason why I avoid so called Cheese Burst pizzas. Despite ording a regular pizza from Jangos, it was coated with this terrible combination of cheese and mayo which was quite simply difficult to swallow.,Never go for the plain cheese pizza. That mayo topping is overwhelming. The other pizza, Spicy Veg, was more tolerable. I hate to waste food but had to get rid of these pies.,A note to the restaurant would be to actually mention the ingredients for each pizza. Mayo isn't a common topping and not everyone wants it.,Love their pizzaaa!,Ordered it because it had some crazy offers on uber eats and since than there is no looking back.,The pizza they serve are very high on quality and taste. What i like about this place is that they keep the pricing very nominal which makes you try new varieties from the menu.,I highly recommend this place for their pizzaa!!"
