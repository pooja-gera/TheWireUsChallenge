## Career Modeling of a B-Tier NBA Player
Web scraping and linear regression project

The purpose of this analysis is to find which aspects of the game lead to most playing time and salary in professsional basketball players. The findings are that increasing shooting percentage across foul shots, 3-pointers, and 2-point shots while reducing fouls committed yield the greatest return in playing time. Once playing time is increased, there is potential for more salary, but it is not guaranteed.  Therefore, a transfer is recommended to a team with higher median salary- 10 are listed.
