Greetings everyone!

This challenge of CSS Drawing is to draw :) The Smiley Face Emoji :)


Concepts to be used:  
This challenge is good if you do it with pure CSS and not using any Svg icons and get along with your understanding of the width, height and border radius. This challenge will help you get your positioning to be more accurate.

So buckle up and get going!!

For Reference in case you still don’t get from the code here is a video to get you going.
