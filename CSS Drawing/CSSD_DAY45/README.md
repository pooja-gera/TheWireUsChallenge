Greetings everyone!

This challenge of CSS Drawing is to draw :( The Sad Face Emoji :(

Concepts to be used:  
Border properties, padding, border-styling, transparent properties etc 
This is pretty straight forward challenge to draw a circle element and draw certain div elements in it.

So buckle up and get started!!
