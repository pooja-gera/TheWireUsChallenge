In the last day we had done the first 3 steps of EDA analysis on Titanic dataset.
Now we will do the fourth step i.e changing names of columns if names are written irregularly.

Fifth step is to deal with missing data.

We can find out missing data using many methods.

Some of them are â€“ 
1.	Missing Data Heatmap
2.	Missing Data Percentage List
3.	Missing Data Histogram
